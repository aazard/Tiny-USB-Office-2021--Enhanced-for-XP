1;Greetings spacefaring being!;
;Greetings to you too;2
;I don't want to talk to you;0
2;I hope you will enjoy our peaceful planet;
;Can you tell me a little bit about it?;3
;Can you tell me about your kind?;4
;I am certain I will. Good bye;
3;Of course. The climate is mild, and there are no predators that are dangerous to us. There is enough edible vegetation to nourish our entire population without the need for additional farming.;
;Sounds too good to be true;5
;I would like to talk about something else;2
;It has been nice talking to you. Goodbye;0
4;What would you like to know?;
;Tell me about your technology;6
;Tell me about your biology;7
;Tell me about your philosophy;8
;Did you ever have contact with other civilisations?;9
;I think I'll explore a little more. See you later;0
5;Actually it wasn't always this way, but we have been able to adjust certain parameters;
;I see;2
6;We have abandoned technology, and now live in harmony with nature;
;I see;4
7;We have found that most other lifeforms live a lot shorter than we do. We do not know why.;
;I see;4
8;Do you wish to discuss the teachings of gzrollazasd?;
;Another time perhaps;4
9;Indeed, 1300 cycles ago, a species very similiar to yours visited our planet. They were suffering from a lack of legs, just like you.;
;What else can you tell me about them?;10
;I see;4
10;They were very friendly, and helped us to adjust this planet. They were in a kind of war at the time.;
;Can you tell me more about those 'adjustments'?;12
;Can you tell me more about that war?;11
;I see;4
11;Sorry, no. They never went into detail, and we do not care for that sort of things.;
;I see;4
12;They are a secret, sorry.;
;I see;4
