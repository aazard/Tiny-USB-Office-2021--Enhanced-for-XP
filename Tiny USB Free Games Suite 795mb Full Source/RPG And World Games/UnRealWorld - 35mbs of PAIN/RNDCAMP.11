Throughout your childhood you loved to listen to the fireside stories of adventurers and hunters
telling of life beyond your small village's borders. At a very young age you decided that you would
one day set out on your own looking for adventure and excitement in the wide wilderness.

After leaving your family and home you've seen a bit of the world and had a bit of excitement as well, but
one day adventure found you instead. While wandering along minding your own business you look up to see
a band of ruffians approaching. They haven't offered you violence yet, but the potential for it is in
their eyes and their hands resting on weapons. Will you try to run, hand over your meager
belongings, or stand your ground against the mob and risk injury or even death?

(This scenario puts you face to face with possible danger. Will you take the offensive or try to escape
 with your skin intact? The next step is up to you. Keeping your starting equipment means risking your
 life and fighting the bandits off.)
