ABANDONED TRAP-FENCE
You find an old trap-fence in the wilderness.

You had been checking trap-fences with the men of your home village and one of them, set for  wild
reindeers, had turned out to be very succesful. At the end of the day you were tired from  cutting
and skinning the catch. Your next trap-fence was two day's journey away but as you now had so much
to carry, you thought that maybe only one of you should go to check it then come back to report.
   You were willing to take on this task and even though all of the men  weren't  sure  if  you, a
young man at the age of sixteen, could find your own way, you were finally allowed go alone.
   The first day of your journey went well. You  recognized  familiar  landmarks  easily  and  the
weather was beautiful. The night fell and you set up your camp, but your sleep  was  restless  and
you kept waking up hearing silent rustling all around you. Finally you couldn't sleep at  all  and
sat up, packed your things and started to wait for the day to break to be able to move on.
   Sitting in the grey dawn you suddenly heard a loud shriek nearby.  You jumped up trying to look
around. The trees were swaying like they were about to fall down at  any  minute.  Then  something
pushed you from behind, forcing you down on your knees. Terrified, you started to scramble away...
   You ran until dawn and as you finally stopped you realised  that  you  had  got  lost.  As  you
scouted around trying to recognize the region, you finally  arrived  at  an  abandoned  trap-fence
which wasn't the one you were looking for.  Still  confused of the nocturnal incident you wondered
where you were and whose this age-old trap-fence was... and had you  been  brought  here  by  mere
chance or was there some meaning behind all this?

(This scenario gives you an idea of what  kind  of  trap-fences  you  should  build  yourself  and
 encourages you to learn by using this starting trap-fence.  It  will   only  need  repairing  and
 improvement rather than construction from scratch by yourself.)
