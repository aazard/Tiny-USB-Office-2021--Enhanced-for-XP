released: Jun-28-1995

 ***         with version 2.071!                                        ***

 - scroll writing/reading improved.

        Contents of text-containing scrolls  will  be  displayed  in  a
        large windows instead of displaying in the notebox.
        Size of scroll-writing window has also been also increased.

 - documentation (URW.DOC) updated.

        Documents are still under construction and some even  essential
        parts may be missing.

 - added notifications concerning healing.

        You will be notified about disease/poisoning progress  if  they
        are getting better or worse. You  will  also  be  notified when
        some injury has fully healed.

 - new RNDWORLD version: 0.2.

        Added bush- and foothill-zones.

 - added more fruitful plants for foraging.

        Now it's easier to find vegetarian food from plains also.

 - fixed possible encounter-bug.

        I've reason to believe that wilderness encounters were  totally
        missing from version 2.07 - anyway that's fixed now.   And  now
        there is some non-creature encounters too.

 - FORAGING-skill improved.

        When fruitful plants are found you can pick the berries/plants/
        fruits by regular pick  up  commands: [,] and [;].  When  using
        FORAGING-skill you may now (depending on your success) find out
        if there is any possibilities of finding vegetarian  food  from
        current terrain or you may  be  automatically  positioned  near
        fruitful plants so you don't have to find them manually.

 - added occupation/status ranks and rank information command: <M>.

        You may now acquire some ranks when joining guilds etc.
        Use <M> command to check out your merits.This command shows all
        your ranks  followed  by  numerical  value (experience points).
        Your rank should gradually raise if you keep on developing your
        rank-specific skills. For example  if  being a fisherman, using
        fishing-skill a lot should eventually  raise  your  rank.  Your
        highest rank is displayed on the  Statistics-screen below  your
        character's name.
        NOTICE! Guilds are still under development -> totally missing.

 - Statistics-screen re-arranged.

 - heavily improved new CRTPLR version:

        - Non-human races have been removed. You  will   now   choose a
          culture you want to born into instead of race.
        - You will learn some family skills depending on  your  parents
          occupation.
        - You may choose an apprenticeship in one guild to  learn  more
          skills.
        - All characters won't now necessarely learn all the skills.
        - You may open new skills or develop old ones to some point  in
          the course of character generations.

 - key-sequence of special command 'Chat' changed from #c to #t.

 - added chat-maneuvers.

        Now there is several chatting maneuveres:
        Greet, Deliver, Join and Unjoin.
        You have to choose one of them every time you wish to chat with
        someone. 'Greet' means general chatting started by greeting. It
        is the most common chatting maneuver.  Other chatting maneuvers
        are mostly used when accomplishing tasks and co-operating  with
        your chatting partner (notice  that  these  may  not  have real
        usage yet).
         'Deliver' means giving some of your  items  to  your  chatting
        partner at first. It's usually used when the person  has  asked
        you to bring him/her some item.
         'Join' means  that you suggest to your chatting  partner  that
        he/she should start to follow you. This  is  used  mainly  when
        somebody asks you to lead him/her somewhere.
         'Unjoin' means that  you tell the person who was following you
        that you have reached your  goal  and  tell  him/her  to   stop
        following you. (So you can't use Unjoin before using Join.)

 - peaceful walking now decreases fatigue.

 - amount of cuts when cutting a corple increased to be more realistic.

 - added direction to FORAGING-skill.

        Now you will be asked for direction of foraging.  And direction
        should be of course chosen to point fruitful plants.

 - added diseases and poisoning.

        Diseases  and  poisonings will  appear  in  the  wounds-screen.
        (special command #w)  There  are  not  currently  barely  other
        plagues than a simple flu but this is still uder development.

 - added new kind of wilderness encounters.

        There may now happen this and that when  wandering  trough  the
        wilderness; you may get lost, hear strange sounds / see strange
        tracks, catch a cold etc.

 ***         with version 2.07!                                         ***

 - <e>quipment function removed.

        It was quite useles; You  can  easily  see  equipped  items  by
        <i>nventory command - not  in such a neat form though, I admit.

 - added random world generator: RNDWORLD.EXE.

        RNDWORLD generates  (in the course of new character generation)
        randomize campaign (called RND) which offers you a  new  unseen
        campaign to explore every time you play.
        (Notice: Old WYVERN campaign doesn't exist anymore.)

 - added start-up equipment for new characters.

        New characters will now get equipped with some useful clothes /
        armours and tools suitable for their profession.

 - potion effects temporarely removed.

        You may still find some potions but they  wont  affect  you  at
        all. Potions  will  be  totally  reorganized  in  the  becoming
        versions.

 - Skills-screen re-arranged.

        'Mastery level' is now colored instead of skill name.
        Preferred skill can be chosen also by moving  cursor  to  point
        the skill and by pressing [ENTER] or by typing it.

 - new poem-generator version.

        Rune singers have plenty of new songs to sing.
        Poem-scrolls contain verses never heard before.

 - Foraging and Vegetarian food-system improved.

        There is lots of new fruits,  berries,  mushrooms  and  various
        plants to find and pick up. The system is now more natural  and
        now  it  depends  on  the  terrain what kind of plants you will
        find. Only confusing change about foraging is that now you have
        to stand ON the plant you are about to pick up instead of being
        beside it as in the previous version.

version: 2.06
released: Jun-02-1995

 *** NOTICE! Saved characters from previous versions are NOT compatible ***
 ***         with version 2.06!                                         ***

 - Skill using/listing commands re-arranged.

        <F4>-key is no longer in function. Skills   are   from  now  on
        listed and also used by <S>-key.

 - added fatigue.

        Your character and any creatures as well will  now suffer  from
        fatigue. Any hard physical activity such as running or fighting
        will tire you up. Amount  of  load  carried  and your endurance
        will affect on how fast you will tire. Fatigue is  indicated by
        'Fatigue'-meter which shows in percents how much your  physical
        activities will be penalized due fatigue.
        For example: Character who has 48% mastery level in SWORD-skill
        tires in combat so that he achieves -2% fatigue penalty so  his
        effective mastery level in SWORD-skill  will  be  46%  due  his
        fatigue. Notice that he might also have other penalties such as
        injury and encumbrance penalty so his final mastery  level  can
        be far lower.
        You may use rest  option  (key sequence: .)  or  #sleep  (key
        sequence: #s) to recover from fatigue.

 - Statistics-screen re-arranged.

        Fatigue-meter added. Coins-meter moved to 'Character statistics'
        screen (<p> command).

 - added new building-type: Farm.

        Villages may  now  include farms where you can purchase various
        kind of animals such as goats, sheeps, bulls, pigs etc.

 - added new item: Rope.

        Ropes can be currently used only to leash creatures.

 - added weapon descriptions.

        You will now see description of a weapon when examining  one by
        an <i>nventory command.

 - armours can be damaged in combat from now on.

        Armours  will   now  break   apart   after   receiving  several
        penetrating hits.

 - added randomly generated villages.

 - added new kind of scrolls.

        There are now also scrolls including songs.

 - added new character attribute: Speed.

        Speed indicates the native ability to  run  when  unencumbered.
        It is linked to Agility and may not differ from  it  very much.

 - added mobility-rate for characters and creatures.

        Mobility indicates how much creatures and you may move per  one
        turn. Any physical penalty such as injuries and  carried  loads
        will reduce mobility.

 - added new command: <R> - Start/stop running.

        You can now set your character running/walking by pressing <R>.
        Running is mainly used when you are chasing  some  creature  or
        you have been chased.

version: 2.051 (bugfix version)
released: Mar-28-1995

        such as poetry.

version: 2.05
released: Mar-19-1995

 *** NOTICE! Saved characters from previous versions are NOT compatible ***
 ***         with version 2.05!                                         ***

 - TRACKING skill improved.

        Depending on your tracking success you  will  now  obtain  more
        information about tracks such as  what  kind  of  creature  has
        left them etc.

 - improved escaping creature behaviour.

        Creatures which can't escape  from you  may  now suddenly  turn
        desperate and attack at you.

 - improved creature behaviour during character's unconciousness.

        Now  it  is  little  less  possible   to   get   killed  during
        unconsciousness. Creatures which aren't carnivorous or  somehow
        murderous will now leave you alone after they have knocked  you
        out.

 - added new creatures: Trolls.

        Only thing you need to know about trolls so far: They're tough!

 - fixed bugs from installation and campaign installationn programs.

 - removed special command: 'Suicide'.

        It simply is useless.

 - added items for writing/drawing.

        There is now Quills, Ink  and  Blank  Parchments  available  at
        lexigraphers store. With them your character can write  his/her
        own scrolls and notes.

 - added new items: Maps.

        Maps can be purchased  from  lexigrapher  or  even  found  from
        dungeons. Only difficulty with them is that you sometimes don't
        know which region they represent, but once you've found it  out
        they can be really helpful.

 - added new command: <r> - Read written works.

        This command is used to read scrolls, maps etc.

 - added new creatures: Rats.

 - added new command: <;> - Pick up something from given direction.

        This command allows you to pick up something from the positions
        beside your character. So now you don't  have  to (for example)
        climb on the table to pick up items on it - you just need to go
        beside it and use <;> command.

 - added reach factor for creatures.

        Reach factor means that in combat some  creatures  (ie. snakes)
        can reach to hit only your legs etc.

 - added graphical symbols for creatures.

        When  graphical fonts are enabled (see option FONTS in URW.CNF)
        creatures appear as a graphical  symbols  instead  of  being  a
        plain letters.

 - scale of local area changed.

        Instead of 33 meters scale of local areas  (encounter  screens,
        villages etc.) is now 3 meters.

 - added new creature-types: 'sheriff','beggar','bard'.

        These may still be under development. Find out what they can do
        for you.

 - added new building-types: 'sauna','bar','inn'.

        Related to these added new creature-types: 'bathmaster',
        'barkeeper' and 'innkeeper'.
        These special building will be documented later.

       Added something fresh to village:

        - Added weapon-skill improvements for specific occupations.
        - CRTPLR now also  tells  which skills will be increased due to
          your occupation selection.

 - added 'information screen'.

        From now on sometimes during the game information screen   will
        pop  up  and  show  you some extra information about something.
        Currently you can  see  extra  information  only  about  armour
        materials. ( by  using  <i>nventory  command and selecting some
        armour)

 - note-appearing improved.

        Old notes (in notebox window) will now be faded when new a note
        appears. This will hopefully improve readability. This  feature
        can be toggled between ON and OFF though.  (See  config  option
        FADE_OLD_NOTES)

 - added FADE_OLD_NOTES option to URW.CNF configuration file.

        When option FADE_OLD_NOTES is set to ON it will show  only  the
        most newest notes (in notebox window) colored and fade the  old
        ones. Setting  this  option  OFF  causes  all  the notes appear
        colored.

 - added new skill: 'SURVIVAL'.

        'SURVIVAL' is ability to survive in the wilderness though  some
        of the 'SURVIVAL' skill can be used indoors as well.  Currently
        you can use 'SURVIVAL' only to collect branches and build fires
        but in the future there is going to be many more options.

 - added new special command: 'Cut'.

        #Cut command is used to cut corpses to get some meat.  Meat can
        be of course used as a food.
        (use key sequence #C to use 'Cut' command)

 - statistics-screen rearranged.

        There is no  longer  'Weapons Wielded'-part  on the statistics-
        screen (right half of the screen).
        Notebox is now two lines higher - this should reduce appearance
        of sometimes irritating More-prompt.

 - added load-restrictions.

        It isn't possible to carry tons of items anymore. Check out the
        'CARRYING LOADS'-section in URW.DOC.

 - new CRTPLR version (2.2):

        When creating a new character it's now possible to select  from
        which season (spring,summer,autumn or winter) you wish to start
        your adventure.

 - added some population to village.

          pc-speaker to beeeeeeeeeeeep everytime  a  door was opened or
          closed. This was somewhat  maddening  bug.  Sorry  for  that.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version: 2.02
released: 30.09.1994

 - shops improved.

          Shops are now paint in yellow :-)  to help identification and
          there is also some kind of permitted hours to visit shops.

 - /-key works also as for far-look.

          In addition to <F3>, /-key can also be used to check out what
          is in some distant location. It's  just  a  matter  of  taste
          which one you should use.

 - added NORMAL_CONTROL option to URW.CNF configuration file.

          Available options are ON and OFF. Default is OFF.  If you set
          this option to ON you'll get stantard movement system   which
          is used in the most of roguelike games.

 - disabled possibility to wear several similar armours.

          Earlier there were no restrictions in armour wearing. It  was
          possible to wear for example several helms at the same  time.
          That's not possible anymore. You can however wear  a  cap  or
          a cowl under your helm and a vest or a shirt (or both)  under
          your breastplate. Shortly: armour wearing rules are now  more
          realistic.

 - initiative granted to creatures when entering a new map.

          This is more real and it also prevents  some  bugs (creatures
          that will accidentally be in  'wrong'  locations (ie. 'under'
          your character) will be  moved to  correct  locations  during
          their movement-routines).

 - added 'store supplement'.

          Shopkeepers will now reinforce their  supplies  if  they  are
          running out.

 - fixed bug in Equipment-function.

          Sometimes Equipment-function didn't tell you  what  you  were
          wearing - that SHOULD BE fixed now.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version: 2.01
released: 04.09.1994

  - 'Brown be' is now 'Brown bear'.

          For  some  reason  anytime there  was  something  told  about
          'Brown bear'  the  game  always  told  you  about 'Brown be'.
          That SHOULD BE fixed now.

  - removed excess quotation marks from interactive creatures' talkings.

          Talking to  interactive  pre-defined  creatures  caused  some
          extra quotation marks to appear - it's now fixed.

  - added PERMANENT_MAP option to URW.CNF configuration file.

          Available options are ON and OFF. If this option is ON map of
          known area is shown all the time. If  this  option is OFF you
          have to press <SPACE> every  time  you  want  to look at map.
          Default is OFF.

  - fixed bug in saving routine.

          Bug  occured when  player didn't  want to quit  to dos  after
          saving and it totally mixed up personal data of all creatures
          on current map.

  - added warning for possibly too little amount of memory.

          When UrW is started it finds out  the  memory  available  for
          the game itself. If  there  is  considerably little amount of          detected memory is
          memory the player is warned and asked if he/she wants to quit
          to DOS.

  - fixed 'I've been attacked but I can't see my enemy' bug.

          This  bug  occured  when  some creature happened to be in the
          same map position where player was forced to stay when he/she
          entered the map (bug was especially encountered  when  player
          entered to buildings).

  - fixed bug in creature escaping routines.

          disappear as well).
