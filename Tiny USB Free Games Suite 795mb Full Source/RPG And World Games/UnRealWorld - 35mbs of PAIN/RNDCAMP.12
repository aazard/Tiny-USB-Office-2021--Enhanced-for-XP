NOT ALL WHO WANDER ARE LOST
You set out into the unforgiving wilderness with a four-legged companion.

Life wasn't easy growing up, just you and your parents on a lonely homestead in the wilderness.
Game was scarce in the area you had settled. Fish avoided your nets. It seemed even the spirits
themselves frowned on your move from the familiar village of your birth. First wild animals broke
through the rickety fence protecting your crops, destroying the spring planting. Then wolves came
in the night and attacked your few animals in their pens, killing most and scattering the survivors.

You set out at dawn to look for signs of your animals while your parents struggled to rebuild,
hoping you could still build a successful homestead. After two days combing the countryside you
returned home with one straggling animal to find your father dead in the dooryard surrounded by
the smoldering remains of everything you had managed to build. Your mother was gone, presumably taken.

Left alone with only the supplies and tools you carry and your four-legged companion you set out
into the unforgiving wilderness, just another wanderer looking for their place in the UnReal World.

(In this scenario you start out with equipment and an animal companion common to your culture.
 What you make of this world is your own choice. Travel well and may the spirits smile upon you.)
