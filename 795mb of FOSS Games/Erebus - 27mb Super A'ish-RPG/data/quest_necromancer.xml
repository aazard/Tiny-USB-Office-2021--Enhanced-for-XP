<quest name="The Necromancer">

<info>After completing your previous quest, you retire with your riches to take a much needed break. You can now afford luxuries that you never had before - a large house, exquisite foods, fine clothes. A year passes by peacefully.

You should have noticed the warning signs sooner, but they seemed isolated incidents at first. Late on one summer evening whilst walking along a country road, you saw what looked like a grinning skeleton behind some trees, but before you could investigate closer, whatever it was had vanished, and you passed it off as a trick of the light.

...

News has been received from other villages of a spreading evil across the land - the dead are rising from their graves, say the reports, and some villages have completely fallen under the control of undead legions.

Many suspect the work of a necromancer to be the cause, and there are rumours that that a great army of undead will soon sweep across the land.

You are eager to do what you can to help. You head east towards the village of Axbury. There you should seek out a person named Borin, who is known for being knowledgable in these matters.

Ah, thank you. Now let's see - it's been a while since I've used this old orb. Yes - ah, I see it now. There is indeed great evil, the dead walk across the land.

A necromancer is certainly behind this evil, but unfortuntely I cannot see his location. But I do see a great concentration of power in the village of Dunbridge, to the east - or what remains of it. Now all I see is smouldering buildings and rotten corpses, slain by a skeleton army.

They are led by a Skeleton Lord, who needs to be slain, but this vile creature is protected by powerful magic. Hmm, I'm afraid that's the extent of my vision. For more help, I suggest you check out Wentbridge Fort, also to the east. The soldiers there may be able to offer help.

I was travelling here a few days ago, but on the way here I was attacked by some savages. Thankfully I managed to get away from them, but they snatched my bag. Most of the items are replaceable, but they took my journal, that I have kept for many years.

I doubt the thugs can even read, it's no use to them. I don't suppose a brave warrior like yourself could find the item? There are 50 gold pieces in it for you. The people here tell me that they keep a camp in the woods nearby. And you'd be doing everyone a favour if you were to get rid of them.

<talk question="Can you help me destroy the Skeleton Army that has invaded this land?" while_not_done="true" journal="Hectar told me that he had created a talisman to protect against a plague carried by the skeleton army. In order to get it, I have to prove my worth by killing all the skeletons in the dungeon beneath Wentbridge Fort. The key to the dungeon is located in the chest in the same room as Hectar.">We have tried to engage the army in battle, but our soldiers ended up being infected with a mysterious plague, killing or severely weakening them.

We returned to the safety of this fort, and set our scholars and wizards to work. They have now perfected a talisman to protect someone from this evil plague. But it won't protect an entire army - we need a hero to venture into the dungeons that have been constructed beneath the village of Dunbridge, and, protected by our talisman, find and slay the Skeleton Lord.

However we can't give away this precious talisman to anyone. If you think you are worthy of this quest, you must prove yourself. Beneath this fort is a dungeon - we use it to lock up criminals, but now it is inhabited by skeletons. Kill them all, and I will give you the talisman. You will find a key to the dungeons in the chest in this room.

<talk question="I have slain all the skeletons, may I now have the talisman?" objective="true">
You have proven yourself a worthy champion, though the quest that lies before you I fear will be far harder. Here is the talisman, and I hope you are able to succeed in destroying the undead evil.
