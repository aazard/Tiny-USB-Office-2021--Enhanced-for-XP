<quest name="The Wizard's dungeon">

<info>As thanks for the success in your recent quest, the village elders invite you to a banquet. After congratulating you, they say they have summoned you here to learn something of a more important nature.

Over one hundred years ago, nearby lived a powerful mage named Vespar. He lived in an underground dungeon. Few were allowed into his home, which was rumoured to hold great secrets and power, though he often communicated with the nearby villages.

But then, one hundred years ago, all contact was lost, and furthermore, no one was able to find the entrance to his dungeon. Even those who had been there before were unable to find it. Some said they had just forgotten, whilst others said some magic had caused the dungeon to have been concealed, or destroyed.

Recently a villager from one of the nearby villages stumbled across a doorway in the mountains to an underground location. He did not venture far, hearing the sounds of dreadful creatures that now inhabited it, but he managed to bring back various documents and artefacts he found in the first room, which scholars identified as belonging to the great mage Vespar.

Since then, various adventurers have set off from the other villages to explore, with varying degrees of success. The scholars of your village however have learnt some additional information. They know that the mage died one hundred years ago, and your village's own wizards have detected that a source of magic lies buried deep within the dungeons. This is, in fact, Vespar's skull, which seems to somehow be still blessed with his magic.

The village elders ask you to enter his dungeon, and retrieve the skull, lest it falls into the hands of evil. They will reward you with three hundred gold pieces. You will also have plenty of opportunity to find other treasures within the dungeons, which you are welcome to keep for yourself.
</info>

<completed_text>The village elders are most pleased that you have succeeded in your quest. They take the mage's skull from you, and give you your reward of three hundred gold pieces.

The book appears to be a journal of some kind - you read some of the most recent entries:

27th - I have decide to explore the dungeons of the long dead wizard, in search of the great treasure rumoured to be found in there.

...

28th - I have received some useful advice, from an old adventurer who once tried to explore the wizard's lair. She told me of a cursed level - every item and offering there brings nothing but misery and harm, except for two teleporters, which she claimed allowed her to travel through time. I am not sure if I believe it myself, being such an amazing claim.

She also warned me of a great beast lurking in the lower levels - perhaps one created by the wizard himself, which she wonders if it was his undoing.

...

30th - Today I set out on my quest, confident that I will soon be rewarded for my efforts with the great riches to be found!

This is a small set of papers, containing some notes. The writing is barely legible, and gets worse towards the end. You read some of the entries:

I have been sentenced to five months in prison, to be served in the mage's dungeon. I managed to smuggle these scraps of paper with me, which I now use to record my ordeal. I have been locked up in this tiny cell, the only light comes from a small hole in the iron door.

...

I have heard terrible rumours of this place, and I don't know what fate awaits me. Every so often, I hear the most terrible screams.

...

Every so often, food is passed through a slot in the door. Though it barely passes as edible, I have no choice to keep off the hunger. I have had no contact with anyone. With no way to judge the time, I don't know how long I have been kept here.

...

Food is no longer given to me. I note that I no longer hear any noises - whether the terrible screams, or anything else. I have tried banging on the door, shouting for help, but there is no response. I do not know whether this is some form of torture, or if I have been forgotten, left to starve.

<opening_later>Hello again?

Thank you once again for helping me. Once I have finished researching from this book that you found for me, I will finally be able to leave this place.

<talk question="Who are you?">
I am Calbert, a scholar, employed by the great wizard Vespar to help in his research here.
</talk>
<talk question="Don't you know Vespar is long dead? It's been one hundred years...">
No, surely not ... that is terrible news if he has died, admittedly I haven't seen him in a while. But one hundred years? It's been a while, but surely not more than a few months...
</talk>
<talk question="Why are you still here?" while_not_done="true" journal="I met Calbert, who has been trapped in his room by a spell, until he completes his work. He is after some information on necromancy.">
The wizard had set me a research task, but grew impatient at my lack of progress - he cast a spell trapping me in this room, to remain until I had completed my task. Unfortuately the answers do not lie in these books, and I am now unable to leave. Perhaps you could help me? All I need is some information on necromancy, maybe there is some resource of the subject matter you are able to bring me...

Ah, thank you! Yes that looks like it will be of most help to me.

This is a heavy book, a journal full of written notes, that talks about experiments, claiming to find an alternative to magical means for raising the dead. You skim to the later pages, and find records of experiments. They refer to unfortunate subjects - prisoners who were sent here for various petty or dubious crimes - placed in chambers, with the aim of not permanently killing them, but to reanimate them as creatures of undead. From the descriptions and illustrations, you recognise these creatures as zombies. It is believed that such beings can be created from the dead with powerful magic from necromancers, though it seems that the wizard was experimenting with a more mechanical means to manufacture such monsters, for who knows what purpose.

"I have discovered an amazing secret!" begins this journal. It details, in an excited tone, the discovery that use of magical teleporters, with appropriate modifications, can be used to send the traveller not just through space, but through time.

The journal claims that each of the nearby teleporters is linked to a different point in time, one to six hundred years in the past, the other to six hundred years in the future.

</opening_initial>
<opening_later>Hello again?
</opening_later>
<talk question="There have been earlier visitors through the 'gate'?">
Yes, and still they remain. I was just a child when it happened, almost forty years ago. Evil creatures of the like that we have never seen before. They burned down our homes and took what little wealth we had, before forcing us to build them a lair. Now they come back to the village once a year, to take captives - who knows for what dreadful purpose.
</talk>
<talk question="Where are these visitors?">
If you really want to go there, they live in a dug out cave to the north. Though I do not recommend it.
</talk>
<talk question="How can I get back through the gate?">
I don't know that. We know of nothing of how such powerful magic works - just that there seems to be no way to use it.

This book appears to be a journal kept by one of the villagers who was kept prisoner here. It tells of how they were captured one day by a collection of monsters in a raid upon their village. Others were slain, including close family and friends, and their houses burned down

They were bound, blindfolded, and taken away, to be placed in a small cell that appeared to be in some underground cave.

Every so often, one of the prisoners was taken away, never to be returned.

You can also see large strange iron contraptions around the place, that appear to be damaged beyond repair. Some of them have wheels, though made of a material that looks alien to you.

Further away, the landscape is formed by fields and trees, with occasional buildings, most of them damaged, some of them reduced to rubble. The trees look burned black, with no leaves. There is no sign of life that you see.

This seems to be a kind of history book, detailing the progress that has been made in recent years. It talks of a thing called "science", which seems to be a means to develop amazing devices that seem magical to you. Together with harnessing the use of steam, great machines have been constructed, far more powerful than anything that can be done by a man on his own.

Later chapters in the book talk of a unification of science, steam and magic, and how this has enabled the creation of even more advancements. The book shows great flying machines, long distance communication devices, as well as destructive and explosive weapons.

    <item name="News Paper" image_name="book" icon_width="0.25" weight="1">
This is a collection of papers, with printed text that claims to describe "news" events. The paper feels old, the text faded. The main story talks about a recently started war, referring to deaths of tens of thousands even in single events - already it seems a war on a scale that you have never seen.

Reading through the details, it seems that wars are no longer fought with sword and cavalry, but with devices that cause explosions, perhaps similar to cannons of your time, but far more refined and powerful. Great transportation devices are also in use, on land, sea and even in the air.

Magic still plays a part, with groups of highly trained wizards being used to focus their energies against the enemy.

A notice in the paper also calls upon all able-bodied men and women to report for service, or face imprisonment.

There seems to be no information on the cause of the war, or who the enemy is.
