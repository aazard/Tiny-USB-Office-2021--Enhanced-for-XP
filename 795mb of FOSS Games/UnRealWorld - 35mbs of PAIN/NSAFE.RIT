With these words you ask Tapio,
The Lord of the Forest, to watch over
you during your sleep:

"Tapio, mets„n herra,
 ota turvaas t„ksi y”ksi,
 suojeluun silm„is alle,
 ettei mik„„n minuun iskis,
 kimppuun k„vis kesken unen."

"Tapio, The Lord of Forest,
 won't you guard me for this night,
 let me in the shelter under your eyes,
 so that nothing could get to me,
 attack me during this sleep."
