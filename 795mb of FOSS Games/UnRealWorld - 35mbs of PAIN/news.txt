This is a list of release notes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 3.62 (stable) 

** Saved characters from version 3.40-> are compatible with this version.                       **


 - added: trading cap for meat and fish

         Villagers stop accepting meat and fish in trading when if they have decent reserves already.
         This cap isn't fixed but depends on village population. Also, cooked meat and fish are often
         accepted in larger amounts than raw.

 - added: digging and filling up pits are now pausable tasks

         You can stop these processes at will and continue later on by [a]pplying your shovel again.
          
 - changed: pits are now simply called pits instead of former vague term 'hole in the ground'.

 - added: tracks getting covered and decayed by snowfall and rain

        Snowfall and rain now affect to tracks getting covered and decayed. You'll notice these effects
        by tracks getting less visible, and eventually disappearing completely. How fast this happens
        depends naturally on amount of the rain or snowfall. Severe snowfall may cover even the fresh
        tracks in an hour or so. Decay caused by rain is often lesser, but still noticeable. The older
        the tracks are the sooner they are prone to decay and disappear in case of both elements.

 - added: tracks left by children now appear smaller

        This includes graphical presentation and description of the tracks eg. "You see here small
        human tracks."

 - added: aggressive village dogs calm down together with their masters

        In case of minor breaches villagers might punish you for a while and calm down after you had
        learned your lesson - but their dogs didn't react accordingly. Now village dogs will calm down
        if their masters do so. This doesn't prevent village dogs from being a serious threat as they 
        don't always reason the power of their attacks the same way the humans do and may cause lethal
        wounds by accident.

 - adjusted: precautions regarding character save failures

        Additional precautions to overcome rare cases of character data blanking upon unexpected
        termination of the game have been added. 

 - adjusted: map maintenance routines
      
        The adjustments remedy rare occasion of too frequent maintenances of fresh characters with heavily
        explored zoomed-in maps.

 - fixed: overlapping tracks modifying the existing track information

        Things like animal size and track freshness were sometimes mistakenly modified by overlapping tracks.

 - fixed: watercraft mistakenly transported with the character when zooming out right after getting on shore

 - fixed: everlasting small bones

        Certain bones would never get eaten up completely no matter how long dogs would chew on them. 

 - fixed: carcass disappearing if the creature dies while making a hole in the ice

 - fixed: human tracks described wrong

        NPC description was mistakenly added to track description. 
        It said eg. "You see here craftsmanhuman tracks." instead of intended "You see here human tracks".

 - fixed: quality improvement when items decay to stale stage
    
        Foodstuff and skins might mistakenly improve a bit in quality when decaying if their original quality
        was the lowest possible. 
           
 - fixed: sages of some cultures not replying with valid phrases when asked for their skills and expertise
 
 - fixed: animals released from the forest cover not following character on zoomed-out map level

        This got broken along with NPC pet ownership additions. Now it works again as it should.

 - fixed: some cave treasures you heard of were never to be found

        The bug was caused by map maintenance being prone to mistakenly remove cave treasure locations.

 - fixed: partially skinned carcasses mistakenly turning skinned upon map load

     This bug usually manifested itself when skinning got interrupted and the character fell asleep, which
     also initiates map save and re-load.

 - typo corrected: angrered -> angered

Version: 3.61 (stable)
Released: Nov-17-2019

** Saved characters from version 3.40-> are compatible with this version.                       **



 - added: companions can help you with hauling and pushing items

          Unoccupied companions spontaneously help you when pushing or hauling heavy loads is 
          being proceeded.

 - added: fence gate

          Gates can be [o]pened and [c]losed just like doors. They can be also built by player character
          from [M]ake menu under B]uilding options. 

 - added: when [C]ommanding animals the animal name is displayed in the menu title

          For example, if you would command a dog called Rekku the menu title appear as:
          "ANIMAL COMMANDS: REKKU"
          This helps owners of multiple animals to be sure they chose to command the desired one. 

 - added: target selection if multiple creatures occupy the same location where an action is to be done

          If there are multiple creatures at the location where you proceed to execute certain actions 
          you will be asked to select the target creature. This applies to following actions:

          - melee attack
          - packing and unpacking animals
          - looking at the location

 - added: limping and animal size tracking information

          When examining tracks now you can also see if the creature is limping. This requires
          character's TRACKING skill to be 25% or more. Severity of the actual leg injury can't
          be interpreted so crippled animals also leave limping tracks.
               Animal size, big or small, can be also seen from their tracks now. This is so
          obvious that only absolutely untrained trackers will fail to notice it. 
          Moreover, the actual track graphics are also shown smaller or larger depending on
          the creature size. Notice that as the young animals smaller in size their tracks pretty
          much always appear as small ones.
               The new information is displayed in tracking messages for example like this:
          "You see here fresh limping tracks of small elk..."

 - added: tree in front of the character automatically selected when cutting branches

          You don't have to specify a direction for cutting and peeling actions if there's a tree in
          front the character you. That tree is always automatically selected for these actions.

 - added: chat option to ask for a sage in the village

          When chatting with NPCs there's now a way to find out ask if there's a sage in the village. 
          "Is there a sage around?" chat line can be found from "Ask for help/company" chat options. 
          If there's a sage you will be told his whereabouts in the village.

 - changed: need for heated room, fireplace or fire are checked first in cookery recipes

          It's more convenient that way as you aren't bothered with meaningless ingredient selections
          if these requirements aren't met. 

 - fixed: failed hideworking with "somebody else got the skin" message diplayed and no skin obtained 

          This rare occurrence might happen if the hideworking got cancelled at the very last minute
          of the hideworking process.           

 - fixed: agriculture graphics representing a planted tile disappearing soon after planting certain crops
        
          This was a result of crops mistakenly entering wintering state if the planting was done early
          enough, and thus the planted graphics was removed. They still sprouted properly though.

 - fixed: wrong inventory weight with certain startup scenarios

          When starting a new character the inventory weight was displayed wrong until you made your
          first move.

 - fixed: gaining skill options during character creation by hovering over encyclopedia hotspot

 - fixed: wrong tying equipment requirements when making patches of items

          This was noted eg. when making arrows. Crafting multiple arrows mistakenly increased both
          tying equipment length and amount requirements.

 - fixed: pushing duplicates items

          The issue was related to ice breaking messing up item data while pushing action was proceeded.

 - typo corrected: "coffing" -> "coughing" in herb effects dialog


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 3.60 (stable) 
Released: Oct-28-2019 

** Saved characters from version 3.40-> are compatible with this version.                       **
** If you are new to version 3.60 scroll down and read changelogs since the first beta version. **

 - added: tree saplings

          There are now small saplings of spruce and birch trees appearing on zoomed-in maps. Saplings are not
          obstacles for movement like the bigger trees but you can walk right through them. Saplings can be cut
          down like any trees, and they have use in making of withes. 

          MIGRATION NOTICE: Saplings can be found only on newly generated maps. If your character has explored
          the world extensively you may want to run map maintenance (key command [7]) which removes unimportant
          previously generated zoomed-in maps.

 - added: withe - a new type of tying equipment

          Withes are tying and binding equipment made from flexible, slender saplings of spruce or birch trees.   
          Your character can make withes from [M]ake-menu under Tying equipment category.

 - added: WITHE game encyclopedia entry [F1]

 - added: fence building now requires two bands of tying equipment

          Fences have been traditionally tied with spruce withes, which are the preferred and convenient choice,
          but any other tying equipment will work as well. 

 - added: villagers now cook their raw meat and fish 

          Villagers will now cook raw meat and fish in their possession. This doesn't necessarily happen instantly
          upon obtaining the meat or fish, but at convenient moment for the villager in question.  

 - added: inventory auto-filtered to show timber when birch-bark raw material requirement selection is being made

 - changed: upon planting something the sprouts are not immediately visible

          Only after some days you will be able to see the sprouts of what you had planted. Before the sprouts, 
          planted tiles appear in thicker prepared soil graphics so you will be able to recognize them.

 - adjusted: village dogs don't bark at sleeping characters

          Watchdogs barking at restfully sleeping characters made it impossible to have good nights
          sleep in a village.

 
 - fixed: using length based items as weight based crafting material got their properties modified confusingly

          For example tanning with birch-bark strips.

 - fixed: hunting NPCs might choose to hunt player character's domestic reindeers

 - fixed: villagers rejecting traps in trading, claiming that they have enough even though they had none

 - fixed: raft weight reasoned

          They've been super light earlier, but now weigh around proper 1200 pounds. This makes hauling the only
          option for moving rafts around on dry land.

 - fixed: young leaves could be picked immediately when plants sprouted 

          Now the plant needs to be few weeks old before picking of leaves is possible. 

 - fixed: double animal skin when skinning the same carcass as your NPC companions

 - fixed: young animals meat yield occasionally being as high as that of the adult animals

 - fixed: NPC butchering/skinning processes in the background might cause player spend times to jump or reset 

 - fixed: NPC owned dogs not leaving tracks in the wilderness

 - fixed: tying equipment return issues after drying/smoking

          If several stacks of food was dried/smoked at the same location using same kind of tying equipment all
          the tying equipment got returned when the first batch of food was ready. 

 - fixed: player crafted items occasionally appearing as roasted foods (if there was NPCs cooking nearby)

 - fixed: when looking at tree harvested of its bark the tree info mistakenly said "partially felled"

          Now it says "bark harvested".

Version: 3.60beta (hotfix 3)
Released: Sep-23-2019 

 - changed: birch-bark strip "usage" bar display removed from the inventory 

          As the strip length is always visble this was redundant.
 
 - changed: when using tying equipment as raw material the selected item is always used in full
            length

          There's a notification displayed if length to be used is far more than required, so
          that you can cancel the task and shorten the tying equipment to desired lengths at will.

 - fixed: tying equipment selections that were supposed to return after usage (eg. cookery, trap constructions)
          was broken in many ways

          You didn't get back what you actually used, but sometimes more and sometimes less. 

 - fixed: shortening tying equipment didn't modify their weight

 - fixed: tying equipment stacking issues

 - fixed: joining tying equipment to exceed lenght of 255 feet

          Maximum tying equipment length is 255 feet. Joining operations that exceed the maximum length
          are now forbidden.

Version: 3.60beta (hotfix 2)
Released: Sep-18-2019 

 - fixed: villagers accepted stale food in trading

 - fixed: crafting regular arrow didn't remove the cord(s) used

SCROLL DOWN FOR FULL 3.60 (BETA) CHANGELOG.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 3.60beta (hotfix 1)
Released: Sep-17-2019

 - added: peeling bark from village trees is considered a breach and not allowed

 - added: building at the village area is considered a breach and not allowed

 - fixed: villagers didn't mind using their lumber for building something

 - fixed: villagers didn't mind utilizing their logs with timbercraft options

 - fixed: wrong properties of player crafted clothes made of other materials than leather and fur

          Mixed corrupted values, from coverage aspects to weight, could end up in eg. player crafted birch-bark clothes,
          possibly affecting modded clothes to appear wonky as well. This also resulted in clothes wearing out too soon 
          if the weight property was one of the corrupted values.

 - fixed: player crafted fur and leather cloth weights calculated wrong

          Finished cloth weights were based on actual material usage, which didn't follow the intended addition of material
          requirements always slightly exceeding the finished cloth weight. 
 
 - fixed: birch-bark ropes occasionally losing their rope status, and not working as one

 - fixed: birch-bark worked as cloth material, allowing making of bandages for example.

Version: 3.60 (beta)
Released: 15-Sep-2019 

** Saved characters from version 3.40-> are compatible with this version. **

BETA NOTICE: 

         This is a beta release. There are likely bugs, things are still somewhat under construction,
         and some of the listed improvements will be tweaked and polished further in patches to follow. 

 - added: active hunting mechanics for wandering NPCs 

         Wandering NPCs in the wilderness now actively hunt animals, and also utilize the kills the
         best they can.
            NPCs seek the game based on their cultural preferences, and within their hunting possibilities. 
         The very act of NPCs hunting, or chasing the game, is rarely witnessed by the player character 
         but bones and remains found in the woods can now tell a story of another human hunter at the area. 
            This addition opens up possibilities for numerous exciting incidents to take place as the woods
         with hunters and their game now becomes far more alive and complex than before. 
         Two imagined but possible examples:
             One day an arrow flies beside your head and is soon followed by a woodsman running past you.
         Half a day later you meet him again happily roasting the squirrel he eventually managed to 
         shoot down. 
             Or you may suddenly bump into wounded and therefore aggressive bear who rushes at you with no 
         warning - only because it had been angered earlier that day by another hunter.
             And so on... 

 - added: hunting NPCs utilize their kills and roast the raw meat

         Hunting NPCs can now skin and butcher carcasses and roast the meat. They also try to utilize
         otherwise obtained raw meat, so after trading raw meat to wandering woodsman you may notice them 
         proceeding to cook it. 
         Unlike player character, NPCs don't leave the meat by the fire and pick it up when it's done,
         but they stay put by the fire while roasting is being done. 

         BETA NOTICE: NPCs are not able to cure or tan animal skins. That's pending to be added later on.

 - added: dog companions for wandering NPCs

         Wandering woodsmen and adventurers you may encounter in the wild can occasionally have dog
         companions with them. And just like dogs owned by player characters these will also protect 
         their masters.

 - added: footwear wearing out in use
	
         Shoes and boots now wear out in use ie. when walking or otherwise moving around by foot.
         Footwear material determines their durability. If used extensively on a daily basis
         an average working lives of different footwear materials are:

         birch-bark - two weeks
         fur        - a year
         leather    - a year and a half

         Walking barefooted, or using simple birch-bark shoes, is now more reasonable activity during 
         the summertime as you may want to prolong the working life of your precious winter boots.
         Footwear will break apart completely when they are worn out down to 50% of their original condition.
   
 - tweaked: armour and cloth quality having greater impact on their durability

         As a rule of thumb high quality items are more durable, and low quality items wear out faster
         in use. This is already seen with wear out rate of eg. weapons and tools. Now the quality based
         durability is extended to cover all the armous and clothes. You can expect rough armours
         to wear out faster in combat, and fine shoes to last longer on your journeys, and so on.

 - added: armour and cloth quality having impact on their protective values

         High quality armours and clothes now provide more protection, and the low quality ones provide less.
         In most cases this covers more than one coverage aspect, but always at least the most important
         aspect for the item in question. 
         For example, fine fur clothes are warmer and maybe have more protection against blunt strikes too
         but masterwork quality fur clothes may also be more resilient against edges and tears as well.

 - added: trying to use village goods for your own crafting is considered a breach

         Villagers now react to player character's attempts to use village raw materials, eg. boards
         and tree trunks, for player character's own crafts. This is considered a minor breach 
         but ignoring villagers fair warnings it may lead to eventually getting banished from the village.

 - added: measure of length for tying equipment

         Tying equipment such as ropes and cords now have a length property. The unit of length we use
         is foot (ft), and should an item have a length property it is displayed both in inventory menu
         and when looking at items on the ground. This addition foremostly affects to crafting material
         requirements which can be length based from now on.

         MIGRATION NOTICE: All the items which are designated to have a length property should convert 
         automatically. So, your old ropes and cords should appear with their new proper lengths 
         in this version. 

 - added: new crafting category under [M]ake menu: "Tying quipment"

         This category contains the usual ropes and cords, which were previously found in "Utility articles".

 - added: join and shorten options to manipulate tying equipment lengths

         Under "Tying equipment" category within [M]ake menu there are options for joining and shortening
         ropes and cords as sometimes specific length is desired. You may not want to spend full length
         rope on something that requires only a short piece, or you may need to join cords together to
         come up with long enough string for a specific craft.
         
 - changed: tying equipment requirements in crafting are now length based

         Instead of requiring certain number of cords and ropes all the tying equipment requirements 
         are now length based.

 - reasoned: required tying equipment types in some crafting recipes

         For example:
         When making arrows, previously you could use any "tying equipment" in the process - including
         ropes. Now arrow making requires "cord", a little finer and more specific tying equipment.

 - added: tying equipment used in cookery do not disappear in the process anymore 

         You can pick your ropes and cords back after the smoking and drying processes are done.         

 - added: harvesting and utilizing birch-bark

         Birch-bark can be now harvested with the common 'Peel bark from a tree' TIMBERCRAFT option. 
         Birch-bark is peeled and removed from a tree in long strips which are then wound to a ball 
         for storage. (As a trivia, this kind of balls are called 'Sommelo' in Finnish.)
           Peling birch-bark strip is slower process compared to harvesting other types of bark 
         which are removed from the tree as sheets. 
           Birch-bark can be also used as tanning material.

 - changed: time of the year matters in harvesting bark 

         You can't no longer harvest bark all year around. The best season for peeling bark is early summer. 
         The process gets more difficult and the yield decreases accordingly outside the proper bark
         harvesting period, and eventually it becomes completely impossible. 

 - changed: bark item properties

         * Alder and rowan bark items are now called a "sheet of [tree type] bark". 
         
         * Bark sheet weight has been decreased down to 0.5 lbs, but you may now obtain several sheets 
           from a single tree.

         * Yield of harvested bark is not constant but depends on character's success in bark peeling, 
           determined by their TIMBERCRAFT skill, and the season when bark is collected.

 - added: birch-bark rope

        A new rope item made of birch-bark strips.

 - added: craftable birch-bark items

        It is now possible to craft the following birch-bark items. Character's CARPENTRY skill determines 
        success of all these birch-bark crafts.

         * birch-bark box 
         * birch-bark basket

           These can be found are under "Utility articles" within [M]ake menu.

         * birch-bark rope

           This can be found are under "Tying equipment" within [M]ake menu.

         * birch-bark shoes
         * birch-bark cap

           These can be found are under "Clothes" within [M]ake menu.

 - added: craftable clothes added to diy_glossary.txt

        Sub-section "clothes" has been added to main crafting definition file diy_glossary.txt 
        and all the craftable clothes can be now found there.

 - adjusted: cloth crafting times and material requirements

        All the material requirements have been increased to slightly exceed the finished cloth weights.
        Crafting times of some small clothes have been reasoned by increasing or decreasing the required time.

 - modding add: =length= raw material requirement tag

        Required length of raw material for crafting can be indicated with a numerical value between 
        equals signs (=). The length unit is foot and value has to be whole number. The tag can be naturally
        applied only to items that have a length property.

        For example:
           {Birch-bark strip} =5= [remove]  

        This means that 5 feet of birch-bark strips are required, which are then removed in the process. 

 - modding add: [LENGTH:] item property tag
 
        This tag is used to specify item length. It's usage is intended for specifying length for
        modded ropes and cords so be sure to use it within proper item type context. Results for
        other than tool type items can be unpredictable. 

        [LENGTH:] - length in feet

	For example:
	    [LENGTH:4]   - the item is 4 feet long

 - added: companions can help you with laborous tasks thus shortening the working time

         Unoccupied companions now spontaneously help you with many different tasks. Their labor input
         helps to finish the physical work in shorter time, but doesn't otherwise affect to result 
         or quality of the task outcome. The help companions provide is imagined to be something they
         can do without specific tools, but the kind which makes it easier and faster to finish the work 
         together. 
         For example:
            When building a log wall it helps to have extra hands around for moving and setting the logs
         in place even if the player character would be the one who does the necessary carving.
            When softening the skin with a beater as a final stage of tanning process it helps to have
         somebody around to check, adjust or tighten the skin if necessary. 
            When setting and retrieving nets it helps to have somebody to row the watercraft.

         The tasks where companions can currently help you are as follows:

         * all the building tasks
         * building trap constructions
         * setting and retrieving nets
         * harvestring bark
         * tanning stages of cleaning, applying tanning material and final softening
         * crafting rafts
         * crafting leather ropes
         * crafting birch-bark containers and ropes
 
         The tasks are 10-20% faster to perform with a companion and in many cases having multiple helping
         pairs of hands shortens the time 5-10% more per companion. However, the benefits of helpers 
         is gapped at three (3) companions, so having more than three helpers doesn't shorten the 
         the working time any further. It depends on the task how many helpers is the optimal number, and 
         this varies from one to three companions.
   
         Companions do help you with these tasks completely spontaneously, without any commands, if they 
         are free from other chores and can reach the player character. You will be notified about companions
         helping you with specific messages displayed right after starting the task. These messages also 
         tell if you are being assisted with the optimal maximum number of companions for the task in 
         question. If you receive help from some companion(s), but the task would be even easier with more
         helping hands the message is, for example, as follows: 
            "You get some help with this task from Ahti."
         And if you have the optimal maximum number of helpers the message is, for example, as follows:
            "Tapio, Korjus and Visa help you with this task."

 - modding add: header tag to specify companion help possibility for do-it-yourself crafts and building

        There is a new tag to be used in biy_* and diy_* headers:
      
        [assist:value] 

        This defines maximum number of companions whose labor input can help to shorten the working time 
        as described above. The value can be 1, 2 or 3. 

 - added: several new companion commands

         Companion usefulness is seriously boosted with the following new tasks they can now do on demand.
         Their skills affect to outcome of the tasks so companions' expertise can be sometimes
         used to obtain higher quality goods than what the player characters could produce by themselves.
 
         * butcher and skin a carcass
 
           Companions can be commanded to butcher and skin carcasses. They go for the closest carcass
           and first skin it if possible, and then cut it for meat and fat. These products will end up 
           in companion's inventory, or are left by the carcass if they are too much to carry.
           Companion's hideworking skill affects to obtained skin quality.

         * roast meat or fish

           Companions can be commanded to roast raw meat or fish they happen to be carrying.
           Unlike player character, companions don't leave the meat by the fire and pick it up when it's done,
           but they stay put by the fire while roasting is being done. Companions roast ten pieces of meat
           at a time, and if not given another order they try to keep on cooking until everything is roasted.

         * make logs

           Companions can be commanded to carve trunks into logs. A few trunks are processed in a row.

         * make boards

           Companions can be commanded to split boards from trunks. A few trunks are processed in a row.
           Companion's timbercraft skill affects to quality of finished boards.

 - added: asking NPCs about their general skills

         Within "Ask for help/company" chat mode there's now an option to ask people about their skills and 
         expertise. The skills NPCs speak of when asked are hideworking and timbercraft as these have 
         significance with the new companion commands added.

 - added: villagers refuse to sell all of their animals

          Previously you could empty a village of its animals with sequential purchases. 
          Now villagers refuse to sell them all and always want to keep few of each species to themselves.  

 - added: village dogs now roam freely

          The dogs you may find in villages are not penned anymore but roam freely at the village area. 
          This not only adds atmosphere but allows dogs now to truly defend the village if need be.

          MIGRATION NOTICE: 
          This applies only to new villages you enter. Villages created in earlier versions for migrated
          characters still have the dogs penned.

 - added: watchdog behaviour for village dogs

          Village dogs now alert of the approaching strangers by barking. Now the player characters may be 
          greeted by approaching barking dogs when they first enter a village. This dog behaviour gets 
          gradually toned down when the player character becomes more familiar with the village. 

 - added: color variety for domestic animals

          All the domestic animals may have subtle varieties in their coat colors. This adds flavour to the
          game world, but also makes it easier to distinguish different colored pets from each others just by
          their looks. 
 
 - adjusted: snakes 

          There was a fistful legacy issues related to snakes which are now fixed and balanced as follows: 

          * snakes now cause point type wounds

            Previously they caused tear wounds, which wasn't quite right.
 
          * snakes now hibernate during the winter as they should

            Previously they were active all year around, which wasn't quite right. 

          * snakes are now slightly more common than previously

          * snakes are now venomous, as they should be

            The snakes in the game are vipers. They are venomous species but the bites are usually not highly
            dangerous. If the venom is discharged upon a bite it will take several days for the snake to 
            refill its venom glands. However, the snakes can naturally bite without venom too.
 
 - adjusted: colorful outcome of eating certain mushrooms 

 - changed & reasoned: birch-bark item weights

          Many birch-bark items weighed too much and have been adjusted as follows: 
                             [previous weight] -> [weight now] 

          Birch-bark shoes    0.8lbs -> 0.13 lbs
          Birch-bark cap      0.9lbs -> 0.15 lbs
          Birch-bark necklace 0.1lbs -> 0.05lbs

 - changed & fixed: foreign traders won't accept more furs than they can carry 

          Previously foreign traders dropped their excess load after completed trade and this opened an
          exploit where dropped furs could be picked up and used again in trading. Now foreign traders simply
          reject the offered items they can not carry.

 - balanced: villagers' interest to buy paw-board fox traps
 
         Trading paw-board fox traps could be used an exploit as villagers did buy them without any reasoning. 
         Now there's a cap for villagers' interest in paw-board fox trap.

 - fixed: tufted duck populations were far too rare. Now they appear more commonly.

 - fixed: cancelled unpacking of pet/companion on a tile with plants caused harvesting to proceed without confirmation

 - fixed: being able to wear fur footwear with shoes or boots already worn

          Fur footwear, despite of their vague name, are essentially fur boots. 
          And only one pair of shoes or boots can be worn at a time.  

 - fixed: being considered defeated (against robbers) when knocked out even if you still had companions/animals active

          The fights which deal with special consequences for the player character's party upon defeat will
          now continue despite of the player character being unconscious until the true result is resolved for
          all the participants. This includes both fighting the robbers, as well as some village fights where 
          villagers choose to deal with nuisances in non-fatal manner.

 - fixed: bears active and awake in the winter

          Now they hibernate during the winter as they should. 

 - fixed: double tree trunk when felling the same tree as your companion

 - fixed: forced swimming in shallow water gets you stuck after 100% fatigue

          This is fixed by character automatically getting to wade mode if the water is shallow enough,
          and while when wading it is possible to rest by standing still.

 - fixed: wading on land

          Getting out of water whilst swimming made the character wade on the first land-tile reached.

 - fixed: [roast] cookery method decreasing also other than non-meat/fish weights

          The intention was to make roasting to reduce meat/fish cooked weight, but it mistakenly extended to cover
          other ingredients as well. 

 - fixed: only one fistful of young leaves regardless the plant patch size

          Harvesting the young leaves you always got only one fistful of them even though there were more plants in the 
          patch. This is now fixed (or re-reasoned) and bigger the patch the more young leaves you can expect to get. 
          However, young plants still yield less leaves compared mature plants so the harvest is still usually smaller
          than the patch size would indicate. 

 - fixed: lavaret (fish) missing price per weight value

 - fixed: same types of fish caught on different gaming sessions not stacking 
          
          This was due to redundant randomized value existing in fish data. 
        
 - fixed: no stags among forest reindeers

 - fixed: companions refused to fell any trees if there was a bear skull pine relatively close by

 - fixed [typo]: player owned pigs sometimes mistakenly descriped as "board" (instead of boar)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 3.52 (stable) 
Released: Oct-28-2018

** Saved characters from version 3.40-> are compatible with this version. **


 - balanced: villagers' interest to buy boards
 
         Previously trading boards could be used an exploit as villagers did buy them without any reasoning. 
         Now there's a cap for villagers' interest in boards and they only buy the amount they want to
         have as a reserve. This varies from village to village, and some villages are not necessarily interested
         in player character's board trading attempts at all.

 - added: NPCs will store the obtained timber in the village

         NPCs may obtain timber (eg. boards) through trading. Previously NPCs just carried the heavy loads around
         causing unncessary burden for themselves. Now they eventually store the timber in the village. 

 - added: roasting meat/fish decreases its weight

         We tought this was featured already, but no. Now roasted meat/fish loses about 25% its weight in the process.

 - updated: NORTHERN BOW game encyclopedia info + image added

 - added: new NPC kid portrait

          Still not much variety with kid portraits, but if you are into portrait customization more of them can be now
          added for kids as well -> truegfx/kid?.png

 - fixed [Linux]: redundant libcurl dependency removed

 - fixed: character creation extra skill point issue for 0% skills

          Increasing and then decreasing skill for 0% level skills mistakenly allowed two points then to be spent
          on the said skill.
 
 - fixed [rare condition]: quest generation and companion rehire delays

          Long lived migrated character might encounter extremely long intervals between new quest generation and 
          earlier NPC companions willingness to be rehired. 

 - fixed [rare condition]: bird thief quest sages forgetting about the quest

          This occurred only with long lived characters. Sages involved in the quest first talked about
          it normally, but might not recognize the quest anymore after a while. 

 - fixed: kids not recovering from wounds and injuries

 - fixed: young animal skins were worth the same as adult animals skins 

          Now the price is reasoned according to the skin size. 

 - fixed: when trading with NPC the accepted items they couldn't carry just disappeared from their inventory after the trade

          Now the excess items NPCs can't properly carry are put on the ground as a common village property.

 - fixed [rare condition]: aquatic birds flying still above the frozen waters

          This was a result of aquatic birds terrain exploration routines failing to find them new meaningful areas to check if the waters at their habitat got completely frozen.

 - fixed [rare occasion]: irrelevant quest related persons appearing in chat dialog
		
          Sometimes you were given chat options to ask whereabouts of irrelevant quest related persons in the village.   

 - fixed: young animals giving as much fat as the adults

          Now the fat yield from young animals is more or less smaller depending on the cub/calf actual age and size.

 - fixed: nameless villagers ie. occasional blank NPC names

 - corrected typos: harvesting dialog "select select the plants..." -> "Select the plants..."
                    northern name "Duo?gi" -> "Duongi"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.51 (stable) 
Released: 17-Jun-2018 

** Saved characters from version 3.40-> are compatible with this version. **


 - added: map of known areas (F6) remembering the toggleable settings to show or not to show cultural areas and map markers

          This was once featured, but got broken somewhere along the way. The settings are remembered after exiting
          F6 map view and persist until toggled otherwise. The display for both cultural areas and map markers is on 
          by default when the game is first started.

 - added: ask NPCs to find quest related persons in villages

          You can now ask villagers if certain quest related persons are around. This is done by automatically appearing
          chat options within the common greet dialog. For example:
          "Is Sampsa around?" or "Where can I find Tornia?"
          All the quest related persons, including the original quest giver, are covered within these chat options if you
          are aware of them. 
            There are some exceptions though; NPCs who are involved in quests themselves can't be asked for others
          whereabouts, but there are always enough common villagers around to assist you. 
            When it comes to finding quest related persons in other villages the chat options become available only when
          you are in the right village where the person can be actually found. This can be considered slightly gamey in
          our standards, but it is more helpful that way.

 - adjusted: no more multiple villagers with same names

        Possiblity of two NPCs having the same name within a single village has been removed. In seriously crowded
        clustered villages it is theoretically possible that villagers might run out of unique names, but real chances for
        that to happen are practically non-existent.

        MIGRATION NOTICE: Within villages created in the previous version two persons with same names may still exists.

 - added: dozens of new northern names

        Due to aforementioned adjustment it was necessary to add lots and lots of new names for northern men and women. 

 - improved: NPC name randomization routines

        NPC culture has more distinguishable influence to their given names. There's noticeable variation between
        the eastern and western names, but especially the current wider range of northern names now appear unique
        from rest of the world. 

 - added: light a torch with another torch
 
        If you are already carrying a lit torch a new torch can be lit of it. This is done in normal fashion
        by [a]pplying the torch to be lit.
 
 - balanced: forest spirit's attitude in regards to hunted animals - size and significance matters

        When an animal is felled the forest spirit's mood change and need for compensation by sacrifices
        now depends on the size and significance of the animal. Previously almost all the killed animals 
        were valued equally by the spirits which resulted in small game hunters often receiving unreasonable
        disgrace. Now it is far more tolerable to hunt smaller game and get along with only casual sacrifices
        every now and then. 

 - fixed: only one sacrifice allowed per day

        If any kind of sacrifice to any spirit was performed even the different kind of sacrifices during the
        same day were considered excess. This was not intentional, and is now fixed back to normal:
        You can perform multiple sacrifices on daily basis as long as they are targeted at different
        spirits, ie. forest or water spirit, or if the act of sacrificing is a part of unique spell.

 - fixed: spoiled food items were seemingly accepted as sacrifices

        Now it is foolish to try that sort of sacrifices.

 - fixed: former companions never agreed to be hired again

        Despite of their "maybe in the future" responses former companions did never reach proper status to be 
        hired again. This is fixed now and companions can be rehired after a varying NPC dependant timespan 
        from few months to full year. 

        MIGRATION NOTICE: Rehiring possibility timespan may appear glitchy as companionship date information 
        was broken in the previous version. For most succesfull rehiring of former companions try it at villages
        that were visited long time ago.

 - fixed: skinning young animals mistakenly gave adult animal size skins

        Now skins obtained from young animals are more or less smaller depending on the cub/calf actual age and size.

 - fixed: village items getting easily corrupt upon crash

        Crash security improvements added in version 3.50 are hereby improved/fixed in regards to certain crash
        vulnerable village items.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.50 (stable) 
Released: 25-Mar-2018 

** Saved characters from version 3.40-> are compatible with this version. **
** If you are new to version 3.50 scroll down and read changelogs since the first beta version. **

 - added: treat bleeding wounds of your pets and companions

        It is now possible to try to stop bleeding of the wounds of your pets and companions. 
        The attempt is started by using physician skill, or opening [F7] wounds screen, when facing a bleeding pet
        or companion. If bleeding wounds are found you'll be asked whether you wish to try to treat them. 
        The actual wound to treat is then auto selected based on its severity.

        The actual game mechanics of applying physician skills to your pets and companions are the same as treating
        your own wounds. Herbs can be used in the process, the success or failure messages are the familiar ones, and 
        so on.

 - added: crash security to overcome creature and item losses when travelling with companions and watercrafts

        There's now extra data save added upon each map load to provide crash security and to minimize certain creature
        and item loss potential. Previously it was quite often the case that the pets and companions you were travelling  
        with would disappear upon a crash. The same sort of crash related disappearence might also happen to the items you
        were transporting with a watercraft - including the watercraft. This sort of losses should be history now.
        Crashes may naturally lose some progress in the game world, but all the creatures and items should stay intact and 
        be available upon returning to post-crash UnReal World.
        Finally, let us remind that force quitting seems to be the most usual type of unexpected UnReal World termination
        and this addition should not in the least to be taken as an encouragement for safer force quitting.

 - balanced & fixed: weight of some clothes

        Some were found too heavy, and a few were found too light.
        The corrections go as follows (with old weight in parenthesis):

        * Woollen tunic - now weighs 4.6 lbs (was 5)
        
        * Nettle cloak  - now weighs 2.6 lbs (was 6)
        * Woollen cloak - now weighs 5.3 lbs (was 6.5)
        * Fur cloak     - now weighs 11.5 lbs (was 14)
  
        * Woollen overcoat - now weighs 6.3 lbs (was 5.5)
        * Fur overcoat     - now weighs 13.5 lbs (was 15)

        * Leather leggings - now weighs 6.3 lbs (was 2.9)
        * Fur leggings     - now weighs 7.4 lbs (was 3.5)

 - fixed [rare condition]: all too frequent map maintenance with some old characters

 - fixed [rare condition]: sages offering the old style teaching of new ritual for some migrated characters
 
 - fixed: triggered traps sometimes appearing as readied and erect

 - fixed [rare condition]: too fast melting of ice in the spring

 - fixed: animals tied in place with a rope remaining tied even if the rope was destroyed (eg. by a fire)

 - fixed [rare condition]: spiritworld related entries cluttering the data stack and causing misleading hoarding warnings

 - fixed: animal pens in the villages appearing too close to the western border

        The problem was that your dog might end up located in the village animal pen when entering the village from the west. 

 - fixed: BUTCHER_CONFIRMATION setup option not checking whether the carcass actually could be skinned

        Now the confirmation, if enabled, is asked when applicable only if the carcass actually can be skinned.

 - fixed: wounded adventurer quest sometimes generating too lightly wounded adventurers

	This made the intended quest giver adventurers not speak about their hardships at all even though
        the villagers would hint about it.

 - fixed: milk from rams and bulls

Version: 3.50 beta
Released: 5-Dec-2017

** Saved characters from version 3.40-> are compatible with this version. **

BETA NOTICE:

        This is a beta release. There are likely to be bugs and some of the listed improvements 
        will be tweaked and polished further in patches to follow.



 - added: wounded or starving dogs may refuse to attack on command

        If your dog is seriously wounded or starving it may refuse to attack on command. Even the suffering dogs
        still defend their masters and themselves from charging predators and enemies, but are just reluctant to
        act as war dogs who always run after a given target completely despite of their own condition. This 
        addition may encourage you to keep your dogs more safe and better fed from now on.

 - added: redrawn 8 directional tiles for watercrafts 

        Both punt and raft now appear bigger and prettier in completely redrawn fashion. The watercraft tile 
        direction does change based on the last actually rowed direction. Credits for these tiles goes to Paulo Spinola. 

 - added: specific animal purchases

        Upon purchasing animals you may now get to choose small or big animals from the list. NPCs still decide which
        animals they wish to sell so the size you would prefer may not always be on the list, but the animal 
        description now always matches what you'll get. For example, if you go for purchasing a sheep with no size
        mentioned you are guaranteed to get that average size sheep - not a big or small one. 
 
 - added: young animals

        Cubs and calves have been added for relevant wild animal species eg. elks, bears, reindeer and hares.
        In case of large species ie. elks and bears, the young ones usually remain with their mothers in the wild for
        a year or two before becoming independent. So now you may occasionally encounter an elk mother wandering
        together with her calf, or a bear mother followed by her cub. Mother animals may act more unexpectedly or
        aggressively than usual when they're still taking care of their young ones -- and that's especially true in
        case of bears.

 - added: different gender dogs

        In addition to plain dogs, which are male, there are now also female dogs. 
        
        MIGRATION NOTICE: for dogs generated in the previous version their gender is randomized upon first load.

 - added: different gender bears

	Male and female bears are now distinguished, females being descriped as "female bear".
        Male bears are larger and stronger than the females, and may also appear slightly more aggressive if necessary.
        
 - changed: some animal descriptions 

        There are some animal terminology and description changes as follows:

        * male elk description changed from "stag" to "bull elk"

        * bears are now descriped as plain "bear" if they're male, or "female bear" if they're female

        * domestic pigs now have gender-based description

          Previously they were all called pigs, but are now descriped either a "sow" (female) or a "boar" (male)

        * reindeers now have gender-based description

          Previously they were all called reindeers, but are now descriped either "reindeer doe" (female) 
          or "reindeer stag" (male). This goes for both dometic and wild reindeers.

        MIGRATION NOTICE: animals generated in the previous version may still appear with their old names.

 - changed: resources of animal origin named in gender-neutral fashion
 
        For example, you'll now get elk cuts even if the animal gender based description would have been "bull elk".
        Or, you'll now get pig cuts regardless of the pig having been descriped as sow or boar.
        (However, a few exceptions to this rule may still occur here and there.)
 
 - added: ant nests

        Ant nests can be now found in the forest. They are needed in performing certain spells but currently have no
        other use or function.

 - added: antlers & bones 

        Antlers and bones can be now harvested from carcasses.

        * antlers

          Male elk and both sexes of reindeers have antlers. For now, antlers simply appear on the ground when the
          carcass has been completely [b]utchered for meat. 

        * bones

          Bones can be harvested from almost any carcass except for the birds and very small creatures. Harvested
          bones appear on the ground when the carcass has been completely [b]utchered for meat. Currently the bones
          you get are imagined to be the long bones (eg. leg bones) containing the marrow. Each carcass yields four
          of such bones. The bone size naturally varies depending on the carcass. 

        Antlers and bones appear in your inventory as tools but have only little usage on their own. Dogs do like
        bones and as they are marrow-containing ones it's also nutritiously wortwhile to feed them to your dogs. 
        Otherwise antlers and bones serve the best as trophies and new raw materials to be utilized via modding if
        you like. 

 - added: skulls & teeth

        Skulls can be now harvested from a few species of dead animals whose skulls, or teeth, have meaningful ritual
        or magical usage. Currently these animals are bears and seals. Animal skull appears on the ground when the
        carcass has been completely [b]utchered for meat. It is also possible to remove and pick teeth from a skull
        by [a]pplying it.        

 - added: meeting the spirit of the forest 

        Naturally this otherworldy creature has existed in the game world for a long time, but now it is possible 
        for characters to actually see and meet him - although it is still a rare occasion. The spirit of the forest
        is famous of being relatively talkative. As a ruler of the forest and its animals he likes to make remarks
        about your relationship with the forest. In case of being very pleased the spirit of the forest may offer
        hunting advice, or even reveal where certain animals roam.

 - added: a quest related to meeting the spirit of the forest

 - overhauled: ritual screen [F4] -> "Spells and magic means" screen

        It's now known as "Spells and magic means" screen and all the new spells are listed there as well.
        "New spells" refers to spells featured in version 3.40, which are learned within quests and performed by
        following the instructions given in spell description by using the common game mechanics and actions. 

        Previously you could view new spell descriptions only from the quest journal, but now it's all available 
        within the spells screen. Whenever a new spell is learned it will also appear in this new list of spells.

        Spells screen also lists some relevant "old spells" which we've had in use for ages and which are performed
        automatically upon selection. However, most of the "old spells" have been removed completely to bring
        existence of magic means to our desired new level. 

        Bringing the selector on any spell in the list displays its information dialog. If necessary, a selection
        is then made by mouse click or enter. In addition, there are also hotkeys for quick spell selection. 
        In most cases the spell selection merely shows the spell information dialog as the new spells are performed
        manually by following the descriped game mechanics and actions. The old spells, eg. blood-stanching 
        incantation or general sacrifice, automatically put to action upon selection. This kind of spells are also
        colored differently in the list.

 - changed: re-organization and removals within the old spell system and spirit world features

        * RITUAL skill removed
          
          It was truly redundant skill, serving only as an alternative way to bring up rituals screen.

        * feature of periodically learning rituals is removed, but the related messages kept and improved

          Automatically becoming aware of new spells over time is history and now new spells can be learned only
          from NPCs within quests. The good old occasional messages regarding how you feel about your relationship
          with the spirits are still featured. (Eg. "You feel pleasant.") 
          Moreover, there's now a lot wider range of these spiritworld relationship related messages and they may
          vary depending on if the pleased or angered spirits are forest or water folk.

        * most of the old rituals are removed

          We've saved only a few relevant rituals from the old days, and we are happy with that. Some of the old
          rituals were seriously outdated and unbalanced in many ways. In case of migrated characters some old 
          rituals are replaced with the new (3.40 ->) spells. 
          Here's a list of removed old rituals with the replacements spells where applicable:
        
          Completely removed old rituals:

          - permission to fell a tree
          - blood-stanching prayer
          - the oath of iron
          - banishing the evil water guardian
          - greet the supernatural guardian
          - the origin of fire

          Removed old rituals with migration replacement spells:

          - permission to sleep             -> replacement spell: "greeting the earth upon going to sleep"
          - hunter's request to catch a fox -> replacement spell: "making foxes to come at the bait"
          - fisher's request for a catch    -> replacement spell: "gaining fisherman's luck"
          - fisher's sacrifice for a catch  -> replacement spell: "rod fisherman's sacrifice"
          - favourableness of the trap      -> replacement spell: "fox trap favorableness"

        * these are the old rituals that were kept as is, or improved as descriped below:

          - blood-stanching incantation

            Works the same as previously.

          - general sacrifice 
         
            The act of sacrificing is now always known by every character from the start, and has a wider
            usage than before. It still works as an act of its own, but now also gets associated with other
            spells as a multipurpose way to please certain spirits for a certain reason. If there's a spell that 
            requires sacrificing which is not described by other means then the general sacrifice does the trick. 
            For example, if there was a spell described as:
            "Reindeer hunting luck is achieved by sacrificing berries on reindeer tracks in the morning."
            Then, to perform the spell you would probably need to find reindeer tracks, be standing on them in 
            the morning and then use "general sacrifice" spell choosing berries as an item to sacrifice.
	
 - updated: SPELLS encyclopedia entry [F1]

 - added: VALUABLES encyclopedia entry [F1]

 - added: SACRIFICES encyclopedia entry [F1] 

 - added: silver valuables as a sacrifice

        Previously sacrifices were limited to food items, but now sacrificing silver items is also possible and 
        necessary in rare cases. You will notice the general sacrifice item selection now allowing to pick an item
        from both food and valuables categories.
        However, silver sacrifices are always related to certain new spells and are not completed unless the
        conditions are right. Upon using silver items as a sacrifice some shards of the item are cut and carved away,
        and eventually the item gets used completely. This makes silver items both higly appreciated and costly
        offerings.

 - added: more spells

        About a dozen of new spells have been added. Like explained above the spells can be learned from
        NPCs within quests, but there are also some new spells which every character knows from the start.

        Here's vague summary about the newly added spells:

        * bear skull rite 

          This spell is known by all the characters from the very beginning. It's crucial common knowledge
          about what to do with the skull of a downed bear. Killing a bear should now always call for executing
          this spell at least.
        
        * bear teeth related spells

          Bear teeth are powerful charms especially for hunters, and now there are spells associated with them.

        * bird and hare trapping

          There are new spells to better succeed with bird and hare trapping.

        * ant nest related spells

          Ant nests aren't merely a terrain feature but also a place for executing certain spells, once you learn them.

        * spirit of the forest related spells

          There are new spells for both encoutering and gifting the spirit of the forest.

        * bear hunting related spells

          There are new spells to better succeed with bear hunting.

 - added: new spells for new characters

        Upon character creation some of the new spells are now randomly assigned for a new character. Depending on
        the character's culture the given spells are emphasized on either hunting or fishing, or both. New characters
        usually start with four spells, and the spells screen is shown during character creation just like before.
        Of the old rituals general sacrifice is now known by every character from the start.

 - added: valuables to be found in the villages 

        Valuables such brooches, pendants, bracelets and so on can be now rarely found in the villages. Type of
        these stocked valuables depends on the culture. Even though it is not in the least common for every village
        to stock valuables the possibility for having acquired some them exists for every culture.

 - changed: game-course completion reward "Learn three new rituals" changed to "Learn two new spells"

 - added: skinned/cut/burnt carcass coloring

        Skinned carcasses now appear in fleshy red color.
        Cut or eaten carcasses appear dark reddish, and burnt carcasses blackish depending on the cut/burn degree.

 - added: BUTCHER_CONFIRMATION configuration option (defaults to NO)

        If the option is enabled a confirmation prompt appears if you try to butcher a carcass before skinning it.
        This is to avoid accidentally cutting up the whole carcass and losing the skin.

        To enable the option add the following line to urw_ini.txt setup file in your installation folder:
        [BUTCHER_CONFIRMATION:YES] 

 - added: SPEND_DELAY_ADD configuration option

        This option can be used to slow down the time consuming actions if you find the game turns running too fast
        for your taste during the time spending dialog. The given value is in milliseconds, adding that much more
        delay for each game turn. Good value to try slowing things down a bit would be 10 and nobody really wants to
        go higher than 100.

        To use eg. 10 millisecond turn delay add the following line to urw_ini.txt setup file in your installation 
        folder:
        [SPEND_DELAY_ADD:10]

 - added: EAT_MUSHROOM_CONFIRMATION configuration option (defaults to YES)

        Yes/No confirmation is now asked if you try to eat a mushroom that is not completely known to you, or a known
        poisonous mushroom. Notice that this applies only to raw mushrooms. When it comes to cooking we assume 
        characters being on track about what they want to do. The option is on by default, as it's most convenient
        for newcomers. 

        To disable the option (as it used to be) add the following line to urw_ini.txt setup file in your installation
        folder:
        [EAT_MUSHROOM_CONFIRMATION:NO]

 - added: confirmation dialog for emptying containers (with other than liquid contents)

        As the contents are discarded for good upon emptying containers the confirmation is justified, especially
        for newcomers. If the container has liquid content the confirmation is not asked as losing the liquid upon
        emptying should be quite obvious.
 
 - adjusted: skiing fatigue rate decreased, walking in deep snow more penalized

        Skiing fatigue accumulation rate is decreased which makes skiing more profitable than previously.
        In addition, walking in deep snow is now slightly more fatiguing than previously.
        As a result difference between walking in deep snow versus skiing should be more signficant now.

 - adjusted: fishing equipment (eg. fishing rod) availability increased among certain cultures

	Somewhat increased among kaumolaiset and kiesseliset, and slightly increased among koivulaiset and islanders.

 - added: fire burns away the ground cover

        Lichen, moss etc. ground cover now gets destroyed from under a burning fire. 
        Only very small fires may leave the ground cover intact.

 - added: winter skin/fur descriptor

        As we know winter furs are more valuable, and it's been like that for a long time. Now there's finally also
        an indication of wintertime furs and skins within the item description. 
        For example:
        "Fine winter fox fur" or "Poor winter bear-skin"

 - renewed & optimized: drawing of rain and snowfall

        Previously rain and snowfall were drawn in putpixel fashion which was often more or less sluggish.
        Now rain and snowfall presented by tile graphics with improved look and fast rendering.

 - fixed: animals with no proper dexterity/strength being able to sometimes open doors

 - fixed: turnip seeds could be used as "vegetable" ingredient in cooking

 - fixed [rare condition]: NPCs foolishly drowning/freezing to death in small ponds at the village yard

 - fixed: bogbean anti-inflammatory herb property was mispelled in flora files and thus not effective

 - fixed: fresh or untanned skins not getting destroyed by a burning fire

 - fixed: villager kotas might mistakenly contain "inside of a building" tiles instead "inside of a kota" tiles

 - fixed: some treasures you heard of were never to be found

        The bug was caused by map maintenance being prone to mistakenly remove treasure locations.

 - fixed: missing chance to get also decent quality crafts at very high skill

 - fixed: companions and dogs not always attacking robbers on command

 - fixed: stone-axe and some knives attack and defense class values wrong

        The following weapons still lacked the intended attack/defense class changes. 
        Here's the list of fixed ones with "old -> new and current" attack/defense class.

       * Stone axe

         attack/defense: 2/1 -> 1/1

       * Kaumolais knife & Northern knife

         attack/defense: 2/1 -> 1/1
         
       * Broad knife & Hunting knige

         attack/defense: 1/1 -> 1/0
         
       * Knife

         attack/defense: 1/0 -> 0/0

        MIGRATION NOTICE: 
        Weapons obtained or created in the previous version still carry the faulty values.

 - fixed: too high quest generation interval in case of some rejected quests

        Some quests (eg. robbers) might come in your way again too quickly if they were first rejected in the past.        

 - fixed: robbers occasionally staying at the same region for all too long

 - fixed: knife price

        Regular knife (called "knife") price was too low (< squirrel hide) and is now increased to intended value
        of 6 squirrel hides.

 - fixed: arctic fox hide price was the same as of regular fox

        Now arctic fox hide is more valuable, as it should be.

 - fixed: zooming out at the very left edge of terrain didn't remember the position when zooming in the next time

 - fixed: buying animals decreasing quest reward credits

 - fixed: depopulating a village might occasionally cause cultural area to be removed also from unvisited nearby villages

        Unvisited nearby villages then appeared as vagabond villages when you entered them, but had no proper
        population or buildings.

 - fixed: "crater" villages ie. village generation failures when the surrounding terrain was of much higher elevation 

 - fixed: indifferent ripe and growing tile graphics with some plants

        For example lake reeds, milkweeds and heathers had the same tile graphics regardless of being ready or almost
        ready to harvest.

 - fixed: trousers mistakenly cover feet

        MIGRATION NOTICE: Trousers obtained or created in the previous version still appear with feet coverage
 
 - fixed: animal in the forest cover quest completion troubles if the tracks got seriously messed up by other animals

        The freshest tracks of the missing animal you can identify do matter. Previously it could rarely happen that
        you needed to burn the twigs on tracks of other animals who had replaced the original freshest tracks.
     

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 3.40 (stable)
Released: 13-Mar-2017

** Saved characters from version 3.30-> are compatible with this version. **


 - added: trapped animals will eventually die 

        Depending on their nutrition and overall physical condition it usually takes from few days to a week 
        for a trapped animal to perish.

 - added: when examining a single piece of clothing/armour the item name is shown in the armour coverage screen

 - added [info]: character creation screen now notifies about wrong character names

        Eg. if there's already a character folder with the same name you'll be informed about it and asked
        to enter a different name. This clears occasional newcomer failures to proceed with character creation.

 - adjusted: craft and task times calculated more independently to overcome time-related abuses

        Previously you could predict quality of crafts and success of tasks from the time required to
        complete them. A shorter time meant greater success for example in case of crafting, hideworking
        or rod fishing. 
           Now the time taken is calculated independently although still naturally based on the applicable 
        skill. In general higher skill mastery level is still prone to get things done faster, but it's not 
        possible to predict the outcome from the required time anymore. 

 - adjusted: trident breakage values

        Tridents were too fragile and breaking too easily. With their wear/break/fracture levels corrected
        all three tridents are significantly more durable now.

 - adjusted: attack and defense classes of some weapons

	Weapons have been checked for their attack and defense class values. Some corrections and rethinking has been proceeded
        as follows, with one item weight adjustment in there as well. Changes are represented in [old values] -> [new values] format.
        The higher the number the better the attack/defense class. 

        * Broad axe

          attack/defense: 3/1 -> 1/1
          weight: 8.5 lbs -> 5.5 lbs

        * Carving axe

          attack/defense: 2/2 -> 2/1

        * Woodsman's axe

          attack/defense: 3/1 -> 2/1

        * Stone axe

          attack/defense: 2/1 -> 1/1

        * Spear

          attack/defense: 3/2 -> 4/2

        * Kaumolais spear

          attack/defense: 4/2 -> 5/2

        * Small trident

          attack/defense: 3/2 -> 3/1

        * Wide trident

          attack/defense: 4/4 -> 4/2

        * Club

          attack/defense: 3/1 -> 2/1

        * Kaumolais knife & Northern knife

          attack/defense: 2/1 -> 1/1
          
        * Broad knife & Hunting knige

          attack/defense: 1/1 -> 1/0
          
        * Knife

          attack/defense: 1/0 -> 0/0

        * Grainflail

          attack/defense: 4/1 -> 3/2

        MIGRATION NOTICE: 
        Weapons created or obtained in the previous version still carry their previous version values. 

 - added: default setup options file (defaults/urw_ini.def) to be copied in place if needed

        There is a new defaults/ folder containing urw_ini.def file which is the original setup file.
        Upon first starting the game this file is copied into game's installation folder as urw_ini.txt which 
        is then our editable setup file. (If urw_ini.txt already exists no copying occurs.)

 - fixed [quest]: wounded adventurer occasionally generated out of village boundaries

        The bug usually manifested with a false adventurer figure appearing on the overworld map far away from
        the village.

 - fixed: armour coverage screen showed bodyparts with zero protection value with the last displayed color

        This was the case for example when checking out blunt or squeeze protection values for nettle and linen clothes. 
        Now zero protection value is shown with very dark (almost black) red color.

 - fixed: dead NPC with seemingly zero weight in "Not all who wander are lost" start-up scenario

 - fixed [modding]: {[TERRAIN:]} crafting requirement tag not properly recognizing "sea" terrain type

 - fixed [quest]: escorting NPC to a village mistakenly accepted arriving at Njerpez villages

 - fixed: "How is it going?" chat option occasionally missing from certain NPCs

 - fixed: troubles of shooting arrows from frozen water puddles at mires

        The arrows did prematurely hit the ground due to faulty terrain elevation calculations.

 - fixed: withered mushrooms had no visible tile graphics

 - fixed [rare condition]: buried treasures being generated on mire islands where it's impossible to dig them up

 - fixed [rare condition]: all the start menu entries bringing up "About" screen

Version: 3.40 beta 3
Released: Dec-30-2016

This is the third beta of version 3.40. Scroll down for complete newslist for version 3.40 (betas 2 and 1)

** Saved characters from version 3.30-> are compatible with this version. **


  - added: zoom option for map of known areas [F6]

          You can adjust zoom level by mouse wheel, or with the following keys:
          CTRL and +   to zoom in
          CTRL and -   to zoom out
          CTRL and 0   to toggle between normal and maxed out map view

 - added: game encyclopedia [F1] entries of the new valuable items

          Information about all the newly added valuables is now available in the game encyclopedia [F1]. 
          Time to get to know those brooches, combs, bracelets, rings and pendants you may find.

 - fixed: NPCs mistakenly speaking of a reward covering some of your trades in villages where no reward was given

 - fixed: quest journal [F2] showing wrong details when selecting a quest on other than the first journal page

 - fixed: map of known areas [F6] crash potential due to excess amount of custom map markers

          Trying to view marker details with more than 10 custom map markers within the cursor radius caused a crash.
          The crash potential is fixed now and in case of spammed markers the information for only the first 10 markers within the 
          cursors radius is shown. Be reasonable with your markers.

 - fixed: inventory mess up potential if torch burnt out when certain inventory related activity eg. eating was going on

 - fixed [rare condition]: false automatic player character attacks getting triggered at random targets at the area

          You might see "You attacks [creature]!" messages, or even get prompted for attack maneuvers.

 - fixed: feathers not burning in the fire

 - fixed: torches burning out while idling

 - fixed: burnt fire destroying dug holes in the ground 

 - fixed: undergarment coverage

          Women's undergarment now covers also elbows, forearms, knees and calves. Coverage of these bodyparts was mistakenly
          absent before.

 - fixed: woollen leggings coverage 

          They now cover also the hips.

 - corrected: bunch of linen, nettle adn woollen cloth weights and prices

          There was some inconsistency and clear faults with weights and prices of clothes such as shirts, undershirts, 
          tunics and undergarments. There are no radical changes, but the weights and prices have been checked and adjusted 
          where applicable. 

          MIGRATION NOTICE: clothes obtained or generated in the previous version still carry the old values.

 - fixed: some typos here and there

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 3.40 beta 2
Released: 14-Nov-2016

This is the second beta of version 3.40. A small bugfix release. Scroll down for complete newslist for version 3.40 (beta 1).

 BETA NOTICE:

        This is a beta release. There are likely to be bugs and some of the listed improvements 
        will be tweaked and polished further in patches to follow.

** Saved characters from version 3.30-> are compatible with this version. **

 - fixed: not always getting the stone back when deconstructing small deadfall trap

 - fixed: credit reward not taken into account when forming a message where NPCs tell you how much of the trade the items 
          you have offered covers

          The credit worked as it should, but the message was broken in case of paying for picked village items. 
          You might get messages such as "this is very marginal" even though the offered items with the credit counted in
          actually was close to asked price.

 - fixed: quest related NPCs appearing in emptied/abandoned villages

 - fixed: quest dialog typos

          "About that %s..."
  
 - fixed: learning old (before 3.40) rituals (was completely broken)

          Characters never learned them during the gameplay.
 
 - fixed: village data corruption potential when saving and loading different village located characters during one gaming session

          This could result for example in [unpaid] tags persisting with items you tried to trade for.

 - fixed: whole inventory stack always selected when using upper case letters to select things from inventory 

          This was due to addition of holding SHIFT down to select the whole item stack interfered with producing upper case letters.
 
 - changed: Markers of completed quests are not displayed in Map of known areas [F6] anymore

          Within Quest journal [F2] you can still display markers of any quest at will, including the completed ones.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 3.40 beta 1
Released: 28-Oct-2016

 BETA NOTICE:

        This is a beta release. There are likely to be bugs and some of the listed improvements 
        will be tweaked and polished further in patches to follow.

** Saved characters from version 3.30-> are compatible with this version. **


 - added: Quests
	
        There are quests - and that's big. We start with around 15 quests in this version, and more will follow in
        the future. It's quite impossible to pinpoint it all, but here's a few lines about the most important ideas,
        features and mechanics regarding the implementation of quests.

        The quest system as a whole is an enormous (and laborous) addition. We haven't taken the easiest path,
        but use verbose dialogue, procedural generation and randomization to maintain replayability and immersion. 
        Quests don't come in your way in linear or fixed fashion. Not in the the same order, not from the same NPCs, 
        not in the same locations, and so on. Some of the quests may appear several times, some only once. 
        The plots vary from everyday chores and problems to folklore and mythology based stories and incidents. 
        We've paid attention to making quests also to fill in the game world and the worldview of the player (character) 
        to good and interesting extent. There are both mundane and otherworldly things to discover, solve and learn. 

        Quests bring a lot to the game, but open-ended and non-linear roaming, adventuring and surviving remains the
        essence. You are likely to get involved in quests relatively rarely. Perhaps only once or twice a month or so. 
        And in the end it's completely up to player characters as to what extent, if at all, they want to unfold the
        quests and stories there now exist.

        * quest generation

          Quests are generated on the fly during the gameplay depending on various factors, world events and pre-conditions. 
          Things like cultural area, season, nearby landscape, character's familiarity, reputation, carried equipment or 
          skills may all affect to whether a certain quest will appear or not. 
          For example, a certain quest might get generated only if the character is somewhat known, has flawless reputation, 
          it's autumn and there's a big lake nearby. Another quest may require character to be a stranger but of the same 
          culture as the quest giver. 
          However, if the world events and conditions are suitable the quest generation also keeps on trucking in the 
          background regardless of player character's whereabouts, actions or status. So, there are quests and new kind of
          events in the world - and then there's the ordinary open-ended life of the character. 
          These two just may occasionally meet.

        * obtaining quests

          Quests can be obtained by talking to people. This applies both to villagers and lone wandering NPCs, although
          villager given quests are more commonly met. Quests can be accepted or ignored at will, so you are free to decide
          in what to get involved. All the quests are told within the chat dialogue which is often versatile and not too
          straightforward. The dialogue proceeds based on the chat options, questions and answers, you choose. You don't
          always necessarily get to know all the details or tidbits. And sometimes you may learn seemingly trivial things
          about the UnReal World in general within the quest dialogue.

          There are basically three ways to find out about a quest:

          1. You talk to NPC and find out about a quest.
          2. NPC comes talk to you and tells about a quest.
          3. You talk to NPC, asking "How is it going?", and they tell you about a person/situation which can be investigated
             further and may then lead to getting involved in a quest.

          So the general "How is it going?" chat option now serves as a way to ask if somebody in the village has a known quest
          or problem of which the other NPCs are also aware of. If there is, NPCs will hint you about it and mention who you 
          should talk to. This kind of hints about quests are often quite vague and call for asking the NPC in question for more
          information. Within this sort of quest hint dialogue you can pretty much always ask where to find the NPC in question. 

          Notice that NPCs may also rarely have personal problems or quests of which the other villagers are not aware of. 

        * quest journal [F2]
   
          A new information page, quest journal, has been added. Quest journal is viewed with [F2] key command and it contains
          the list and details of quests the character is currently involved in, or has completed in the past. 
            Quest journal main page shows the list of quests along with their titles, quest giver information, assignment and 
          expiration dates. You can then select a quest from the list to view it in detail.
            Detailed quest information is provided by showing all the relevant talk lines you have heard from NPCs. We don't
          use ordinary "your goal is to..." quest summaries, but instead you'll see the exact information you've been told. 
          Should you discover new information from NPCs along the way the quest journal details will update accordingly.
            From the quest details page you can also view the quest related map markers. See below.
 
        * quest related map markers

          Quests also add markers on the map of known areas. Locations of the related NPCs you have met and talked to are always
          marked on the map, but there can be also markers of important quest related areas - if you have found about them. 

          There's "[F6] Map locations" option at the bottom of each quest details page. It shows the map of known areas with
          markers of the said quest. Like all the map markers also the quest related markers can be pointed and clicked, or 
          selected by keyboard, to view the associated information.

          There are two types of quest related markers: 'Quest location' and 'Quest related area'. 

            'Quest location' marker shows locations of NPCs you have obtained quest related information from. These are the
          locations where you originally heard NPCs talking about the quest. Clicking the marker shows the quest in question
          and the related NPC description. You often need to return back to the quest giver after completing the quest
          further away, and these markers help you to find your way at the important quest related people you have met.

            'Quest related area' marker indicates a specific quest related area or location somebody has told you about. 
          Quest related locations are always described also verbally within the quest dialog, but in some cases the area 
          markers appear to indicate rough whereabouts of the place in question. Size of the quest related area markers 
          can vary, and they foremostly give you an initial idea of the area where to head for further investigation. 
          Clicking the marker shows the quest in question and what the marked area is about.
           
        * quest rewards

          You may get rewarded by NPCs for completing a quest. There are different types of reward, and here's briefing of
          the most important ones. In addition, completing quests also quite often increase your reputation in the eyes of 
          the whole village, or the solitary NPC in question.

          - items

            NPCs can reward you with variety of items. Sometimes these are plain ordinary items, but there are also new items
            you can obtain only by completing quests. These new special items are often somehow magical or enchanted in nature.
            NPCs will describe you the properties and usage of the new special items within the quest dialog. 

          - get taught in skills 

            You can get rewarded with a lesson in certain skill which improves the said skill with 3-6 points the next time
            you use it in true situation. The lower the skill level is the greater skill improvement results from a given lesson.
            Having to actually use the skill after the lesson means that in case of a tracking lesson the improvent requires
            tracking skill to be used where there actually are tracks to spot. And in case of a sword lesson, the improvement
            requires a true sword combat maneuver to be executed. And so on.

          - village goods of your choice for free

            You can get village goods up to certain value for free. Upon getting this kind of reward NPCs usually tell you the
            value of the reward in squirrel hides which gives a rough idea about what you can expect to get. 
              The village goods you can get for free can be anything that villagers would also normally trade, and you can 
            choose the goods from storehouses or individual NPCs. In practice this reward works like having a certain amount of 
            trading credit.
              After picking up your selections the items appear as 'unpaid' and you claim them to yourself through trading options
            the same way as you would normally trade for unpaid items. But now upon starting to trade, with the reward active, 
            villagers tell you how much of the selected items your reward covers. If your reward doesn't cover all of the trade
            you need to pay for the remaining amount by normal means of trading. If the reward covers all of the trade you don't
            naturally have to pay anything, and the remaining value of the reward can be claimed later on. You can change your 
            mind, decide whether to accept the deal or not and all that just like in normal trading. 
              It is the same with getting reward provided items from individual NPCs. Start trading, make your selections and they
            will tell you how much, if at all, you need to pay. Moreover, individual NPCs are usually more willing to give their
            goods as a reward as they would in normal trading situation.
              You don't have to use the reward right away or at once, but can spend it at any time you desire. Everytime you claim
            some free goods NPCs will remind you about how much of the reward still remains.

          - spells

            You may learn new spells both as a quest reward and during the quest dialogue in general. These new spells vary from
            hunting and fishing spells to interacting with the spirit world. Sometimes the spells itself or following the magical 
            means NPCs describe are required to complete certain quests. See separate spells section below for more information.

          - treasure tales

            NPCs who know about treasures may reveal the information about what is hidden and where as a reward. You'll usually
            obtain enough verbal information to go search for the treasure, but the rough whereabouts of the treasure also gets 
            marked as quest related area on the map of known areas.
  
 - added: new spells, in a new way
	
        There are around 20 new spells and magical means to learn and perform. The new spells differ a great deal from the common
        rituals (F4) in their content and way of performance. We'll get into details below, but this all can be very well considered
        the start of the spell system and spirit world overhaul. The new spells are based on the worldview and beliefs of the 
        ancient Finns - with a greatest ambition. All the new spells are based on the actual collected hunting and fishing spells. 
        We've pursued, in a lack of better words, for historical and mythological accuracy  This comes down not only to spell 
        backgrounds or verbal description but also to how the spells were actually performed. The new spells are not simply selected 
        from the list for the magic to happen, but performed with the actual player character actions which vary for each spell. 

        * The new spells can be learned from NPCs within quests. Verbal information to perform these spells can be then found within
          quest dialog in the quest journal. (In the future versions we'll make the new spells appear in the ritual screen [F4] as well.)
          As the spell descriptions are sometimes verbose and contain background information too they can also reveal you a little 
          something about the people's worldview and beliefs in general.

        * The new spells are often "do like this and that will happen" kind of things. To perform a spell in question you then
          need to follow the instructions by using the common game mechanics and actions. 
          For example, if the spell instructions would say "throw three rocks at a spruce tree before the sunrise and your loop snares
          will be favourable" the spell would be performed by throwing three rocks at a spruce tree before the sunrise. 
          That's just an example and not an actual magical mean there is in the game, but you get the picture. 
            When the spell required actions have been executed there's no notification of any kind about a succesfully performed spell.
          If you did the right actions you've performed the spell right, and some magic did happen. If the spell actually worked in the
          game world or not, well, that is hopefully to be noticed at some point. That's how the spells work.
	
        * Effects of the spells and magical means are vague and subtle as usual. Some spells are simple, some are more complex, but most
         often they consists of seemingly ordinary things that have magical meaning behind them once you know it. There are rarely 
         evident results to be noticed, but nevertheless the magical, ritualistic and mythical actions you learn and perform have impact
         on the game world. 

 - added & improved: valuables

        Dozen of new valuable items have been added with deep thought, based on archeological findings and inspired by historical 
        references. The assortment of valuables now consist of brooches, combs, pendants, bracelets and rings made of bronze and silver. 
        All the valuables are now also culturally dependent. Valuables are still very rare and mostly carried by wealthy traders, or 
        found in treasure caches. 

 - added: valuables for foreign traders

        Foreign traders may now carry some valuables for trading. 

 - added: treasure caches

        People may have hidden their wealth and valuables for variety of reasons at varying locations, and you may sometimes stumble
        upon these treasure caches. They can be found by mere accident, but far more likely after hearing treasure tales from 
        NPCs within certain quests. The most common locations for treasure caches are caves, cliffs and islands. Treasures can be also
        buried in the ground and can't be easily found unless you have heard where to dig.
        Different cultures have different opinions about what can be considered a treasure worth of hiding, so the items to be found
        in treasure caches are culturally dependent. Hiding the rare valuables is common for all the cultures, but treasures of 
        UnReal World more often consist of everyday items such as tools, weapons, grains, clothes or furs.

 - added: meeting and seeing the spirits for real

        Many kind of spirits and otherworldly creatures have always existed in UnReal World, but they haven't appeared for player characters
        in visible form - until now. Now it's remotely possible for some player characters to actually see certain spirits in the game world.

 - added: holding SHIFT down selects the whole stack when selecting items in inventory with ENTER or mouse click

 - added: telling a difference between running and walking tracks

        Upon examining tracks you can now distinguish animal running tracks from the regular walking tracks, depending on your 
        tracking skill and strength of the tracks. When running tracks are spotted they are simply mentioned to be "running tracks"
        instead of just "tracks". For example: "You notice here [track and animal information] running tracks."
     
 - changed: [f]ire and [b]utcher commands removed from [r]epeatable tasks
	
        As these commands have hotkeys of their own it was in vain to have them occupy [r]epeat list.

 - changed: dog skin is now classified as fur

 - adjusted: forest reindeers are now a bit more timid than previously

 - fixed: bug potential of domestic animals getting transported from their pen at overworld map

 - fixed: rafting characters occasionally located on dry land when zooming in near certain terrain types 

 - fixed: occasional decent quality crafts from worse quality raw materials

 - fixed: boil recipe requirements order

     A cooking pot was asked before the water, which isn't preferred order. Now it's water first, then a cooking pot.

 - fixed: wrong flatbread graphic tile 

 - fixed: containers disappearing when utilizing a stack of containers filled with required ingredients/raw materials

 - optimized: hungry dog food searching routines 
	
	Having multiple leashed hungry dogs following you could cause slowdown on certain zoomed-in areas due to their
        food searching routines. This has been optimized now for way faster performance now.

 - fixed: [unpaid] tag persisting if unpaid items were offered back to NPCs during the trade

        This occasionally resulted in items becoming impossible to trade for after NPCs had stocked them back to storehouses.

 - fixed: all the village dogs wanting to follow you if you bought one of them

        This resulted in irrelevant confirmation messages when zooming out nearby villages.

 - fixed: village fields the player character had visited for the first time in early spring not always getting resown properly 

 - fixed [rare condition]: crashing on zoomed-in maps with lots of holes in the ice and creatures falling through the ice

 - corrected: woollen dress weight, 

        It was 5 lbs, which was too low. Now woollen dress weighs 6.5 lbs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 3.32
Released: May-18-2016

** Saved characters from version 3.19-> are compatible with this version. **


 - added: need to pay companions & companion inventory restrictions

        * companion inventory restrictions 

          You can't anymore freely pick all the items of your companions to yourself. Companions now tend to keep 
          their most valuable and usable personal items to themselves, and usually only the cheap items and
          food are freely pickable. However, all the items you have delivered to your companion can be picked 
          back at will if they are not in use (wielded or worn) at the moment. So it is still safe to pack or lend 
          your companions even the most valuable goods you have.
        
        * need to pay companions for their days of service and items claimed

          Companions now require some reward for their days of service. Their price is roughly a value of one squirrel 
          hide per day of service and you can pay them basically with any valuable goods. Also, if you have claimed
          companion's items to yourself they expect to be paid for those items too. In short, companions now always
          expect to leave with more valuable inventory than what they had upon recruitment.

          A day before companions are about to leave they'll let you know how they feel about their equipment
          and whether they expect to be paid more. If more payment is wanted simply deliver items to your
          companions and they'll let you know when they are happy with it. You don't have to do it at once
          but have the whole day to settle the payment. Talking to your companion at any time ("Greet" or "Ask for help"
          chat options) will also make them speak their mind about the remaining payment.

          If you fail to pay companions before they leave you'll be reminded about it the one last time. From there on 
          you can still deliver goods to settle the payment, but ex-companions don't necessarily stay around for
          too long. Failing to pay companions lowers your reputation in their village, and makes hiring new companions
          there quite difficult. 
        
        * migration notice

          Companions hired in the previous version behave differently. They still have unrestricted inventorys, and 
          may or may not ask for payment when parting. 

 - tweaked: recruiting companions who carry village property from failed/cancelled trades
 
        There are two new conditions to prevent exploiting companion recruiting with returned village goods:

        * Companions don't count the returned village property as their own when checking if they have enough 
          equipment to join you. 

        * When companion agrees to join you they won't keep carrying the returned village property but drop it on 
          the ground where other villages come to reclaim it.

 - changed: children won't anymore participate in picking up village property left on the ground 
            after failed/cancelled trades

        This is because you can't do one-to-one trading with children, and sometimes you would like
        to go for that with some items NPCs just picked.

 - added: NPCs wearing the new clothes/armours they get

        NPCs can now actively wear the new clothes/armours they have obtained. They'll usually
        go for wearing new clothes/armours after being delivered or having picked some. 
        Delivering useful pieces of clothing/armour to your companion is now worthwhile, even
        though NPCs make the final decision whether they will wear something or not.

 - added: pull heavy items to your location with [;] pick up from adjacent tile command 

        If the items you tried pick up from adjacent tile were too heavy to lift you'll be asked
        if you want to pull them to your location. 

 - fixed [rare condition]: segfault upon launching the game on some Mint/Ubuntu systems

 - fixed [rare condition]: NPCs being able to fall asleep while in the water 

        At its worst this resulted in villagers foolishly drowning/freezing to death.

 - fixed [modding]: [naming] tag not working properly when crafting while NPC is felling a tree

 - fixed: creature total injury not always increasing if the number of maximum unique injuries was reached

        This resulted in occasional difficulty to finish creatures with minor impact wounds.

 - fixed: corrupt description of "An Island" game course task

 - fixed: finishing tasks (eg. felling a tree) by grinding when too tired to continue

        When tasks were cancelled because of being too tired to continue repeating the command still 
        always added one minute of progress and you could finish the task by this sort of grinding. Fixed now.
 
 - fixed: bears (and possibly other creatures too) occasionally entering into indecisive fighting mode

        They might keep constantly switching between attacking and fleeing without really making any
        attack maneuvers. Fixed now. 

 - adjusted: tiny increase in lynx and glutton aggressiveness potential, especially in case of them being wounded.

 - added: daily tolerance for stimulant herbal effect 

        Consuming stimulants doesn't anymore decrease the exhaustion seemingly indefinitely, but stops when
        a certain daily level is reached.

 - tweaked: net fishing 

        * catch check time window now hourly based

          Net fishing catch checks are now hourly based instead of previously used morning based checks.
          This means you can catch fish with nets within a shorter time window. Even within an hour from
          setting the net - if you're lucky and the conditions are right. Naturally the longer the nets
          have been set the greater the catch usually grows so hasty checks usually provide only a few fish.
          Despite of the shorter time window it should be still remembered that in addition to your fishing 
          skill level the factors such as terrain, water depth and time of the day also contribute
          to what kind fish and how much of it your net is likely to catch - if at all.

        * gradual catch spoilage 

          Catch spoilage due to fish eventually dying in unretrieved nets is now gradual. You may still be
          able to get some of catch good and edible even if the nets have been left unretrieved for days. 
          In general it's still advisable to check your nets at least on every other day.

        * setting multiple nets to same tile now forbidden

 - tweaked: NPC sleeping related oddities and exploits 

        * NPC won't anymore fall asleep outside when it's raining. 
  
        * Njerpez and foreign traders met in the wild won't fall asleep so easily anymore if they're within 
          player's sight when the encounter happens.

          Sleeping NPCs in the wild still can encountered, but this fixes the exploitish procedure of encountering
          people at night hoping them fall asleep on the next move.

 - tweaked: restricted possibility to [w]ield skis

        Skis are put on by [a]pplying them but having been able to wield them too caused confusion.

 - changed: pine-marten aggressive sound is now 'snuffle' instead of 'snort'


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 3.30 - patch 1
Released: Mar-9-2016

** Saved characters from version 3.19-> are compatible with this version. **

[this was a small patch update, scroll down for complete 3.30 changelog]

 - fixed [rare condition]: items/materials being worked on not always removed properly

        eg. trunk not removed when carved into log, or berry shrub not emptied despite of being picked

 - fixed [rare condition]: difficulty to produce colon symbol (:) on some keyboards

 - fixed: disappearing animal leashes
 
 - fixed: some NumLock related hassle when playing with NumLock ON

         * double numbers getting produced in text input fields when using numpad to type numbers with NumLock ON
         * number binded commands (eg. attack commands) occasionally getting triggered when moving around
         * jumpy target selection by keyboard if NumLock was ON

 - fixed: some knives mentioned belonging to (old) group of daggers when examining them in inventory

         In action dagger classified weapons still use the knife skill, so this was mostly a mere description hassle.

 - fixed [rare condition]: consuming clothes instead of food

         Happened when switching windows while [e]at menu was open.

 - fixed [OS X]: map refresh problems in target selection with FAST_TARGET_CURSOR mode on

 - tweaked: NIGHT BRIGHTNESS setup option maximum value increased to 60 (was 30)

 - tile graphics overhaul 

	We've accomplished quite a graphics update and along with hundreds of redrawn 
        tiles the game has got a whole new outlook new. To put this monumental task in a 
        nutshell it goes as follows:

        * overhauled tile graphics engine

          New tile system requires a new engine and that's what we have done.
          The new engine isn't limited just for drawing static map tiles, but also allows
          other improvements in graphical presentation of UnReal World which are explained 
          further in this newslist. 

        * redrawn tiles

	  Majority of tiles have been redrawn and there are also lots and lots of new unique
          tiles for old items. For example, all the knives and swords have their own tile
          instead of one generic tile being used for every knife or sword.
          New tiles are located in truetile/ folder. 
          There's also truetile/readme.txt containing general information and modding
          guidelines.
          Nice bunch of tile contributions for this version come from Wickham's tileset.

        * separate files for each tile - easier modding of tile graphics

	  Sprite sheets are gone and each tile is now in a separate file. This makes modding
          and personal customization of graphics far more easy. 

          You can specify tile graphics for modded items with new [TILEGFX:] tag which
          is explained further in this newslist. To add a new graphic tile for modded item
          just create a new tile graphic file in truetile/ folder and use the tag to let 
          the game know to use that tile.
         
        * graphical compatibility with old savegames and mods remains

          Despite of huge changes in tile graphics structure compatibility with savegames and  
          even old mods should work quite well. The game corrects references to old indexed vanilla 
          tiles on the fly and shows the applicable new tiles instead. However, updating your 
          mods to use new tile system is advised. See usage of [TILEGFX:] tag to associate new tiles 
          to your mods further in this newslist.

 - variety of graphical goodies and tweaks

        With the power vested in new tile graphics engine the following graphical goodies and tweaks
        have been implemented:

	*  enhanced missile attack graphics

           Missile weapons and arrows are now drawn flying their head towards the target. 
           Other than missile weapons now spin around in the air when they are thrown.

	* enhanced fire graphics

          - Fires now spread a flickering circle of light around them which brightens and tints the surrouding
            terrain and items. The effect is most immersive (and most necessary) during the darkest hours.
          - Fires are now animated with three frames which makes them look more lively
          - Size of the fire is now represented by scaling the fire sprite instead of using multiple sprites.
            
	* direction-wise track graphics 
         
          Tracks of creatures are now drawn to their actual direction. 

        * two facing direction graphics for all the creatures; east and west

          If a creature is facing towards NE,E,SE or S its' eastward graphic tile is used.
          If a creature is facing towards N,NW,W or SW its' westward graphic tile is used.
          In the future we'll be featuring creatures drawn to all eight facing direction, but this is a start.
          The good old little blue arrow beside the creature still shows its' exact facing direction.

        * direction arrow and two facing direction graphics for player character

          Facing direction of the player character is now shown with little yellow arrow beside the avatar.
          And just like the creatures the player avatar also has two facing direction graphics; east and west.

	* when skiing the skis are now actually drawn under the character

        * some plants have more growth stages than previously so you can expect to see more varying plant 
          graphics during their lifespan

 - statistics/messages screen viewport rearranged

	* Usage of the upper right corner real-life action images is over. 
          It's end of an era, but maybe they'll return someday in new style. 
          Instead of action images character portrait is now shown in the upper right corner.

        * The old green character heading box has been removed.
          Heading direction and sound clues are now shown within the new upper right corner heading box.

        * Nutrition/warmth/vigour and wielding dialogs have been rearranged and stylized.

        * Game messages dialog has been enlargened.

        * Graphical clues of heard sound directions now stay visible for a longer time and fade away gradually. 
          These sound clues are shown within the new upper right corner heading box.

 - added: player character avatar graphic clues for running and hiding movement modes

        When running some "dust" is drawn at character avatars feet.
        When hiding character avatars is tinted with green.

 - added: [F9] key command to reload tile graphics

        Pressing [F9] will reload the tiles. It's easier to mod graphics now as you can edit a tile, 
        save it and then reload the graphics while the game is running to see the chances in action 
        right away.

 - added: day and night lighting cycle
	
	Map color scheme now changes according to time of the day and time of the year.
        The lighting change is based on realistic solar elevation angle on northern hemisphere on a given game-time moment 
        and it's calculated and applied smoothly once per game-minute. Daylight slowly turns into twilight, dusk and night -
        and then into dawn again.

        The change of seasons, and the great seasonal variation in length of days and nights in the Far North is now far more
        concrete and immersive.
        During midsummer the sun barely sets at all and nights are light and short.
        During midwinter days are really short and nights are long. 
        And late autumn nights are the darkest ones, until the snow comes.

 - added: NIGHT_BRIGHTNESS configuration option

        If the night time tint appears too dark on your monitor you can increase the brightness by adjusting NIGHT_BRIGHTNESS
        value in urw_ini.txt or via in-game setup options.
        Possible values are 0-30, and it's set to 0 by default.

 - added: MAP_LIGHTING_EFFECTS configuration option

        You can toggle day and night color-scheme and fire tint effects by modifying MAP_LIGHTING_EFFECTS 
        value in urw_ini.txt or via in-game setup options. On older computers these effects may cause slow
        performance or flashing of the screen and can be disabled if necessary.

 - added: MAP_GRID configuration option

        If the new tile graphics perspective gives you hard time to figure out which tile you are at you can
        enable map grid by modifying MAP_GRID value in urw_ini.txt or via in-game setup options. 

 - added: OLD_HARDWARE_MODE configuration option

        If you've got an older computer and rendering fails you can try enabling old hardware mode.
        This mode uses software rendering and should be used only if absolutely necessary.
        Enable by modifying OLD_HARDWARE_MODE value in urw_ini.txt or via in-game setup options. 

 - added: RIGHT_ALT_HOTKEYS configuration option

        Defines if Right Alt (AltGr) key is enabled for activating ALT+hotkey game shortcuts.
        On some keyboard layouts Right Alt is used to produce letters and can be disabled if need be
        by modifying RIGHT_ALT_HOTKEYS value in urw_ini.txt or via in-game setup options. 
        Defaults to YES. 
        Possible values:
        YES - use right alt for activating game shortcuts
        NO  - don't use righ alt for activating game shortcuts

 - weather overhaul

        The weather engine has been rewritten from a scratch and we've got detailed and realistic simulation of 
        weather factors such as rain, snowfall, solar elevation angle and temperature changes. The new weather 
        engine deals with numerous weather variables and much greater annual and seasonal changes are to be expected. 
        Put it in short; the years are less alike from now on.
        
        Here's a list of the most exciting and important weather related improvements and mechanics:

	* snowfall

	  It can snow for real in the game now, and you can see it snowing. There can be different levels of snowing,
          and with the new weather engine in action the first snow naturally doesn't fall the same day every year. 
          Snow thickness is now tracked per 1mm and each hour of snowfall will make the snow grow thicker and thicker. 
          Similarly the snow melts away gradually when it gets warm enough.
 
          - Visibility of tracks on the snow now depends on snow thickness. You can expect to notice less tracks when
            the snow cover isn't all that thick.

          - How fatiguing it is to walk in the snow now depends on snow thickness. You can expect to 
            get less fatigued from walking in the snow in early and late winter when the snow cover isn't 
            very thick.

          - Snow depth is told to you when you look at ground tiles that aren't occupied by items.
            Instead of plain "Ground" you'll now get verbal description of the snow depth 
            for example as follows:
            "Faint snow", "Thin snow", "Fist deep snow", "Ankle deep snow", "Calf deep snow",
            "Waist deep snow", "Chest deep snow" etc.

	* realistic modelling of ice and freezing of lakes

          Pretty much everything related to ice has been overhauled.
	  Lakes start to freeze when the weather gets cold enough. This doesn't happen the same time every 
          year, and the ice also doesn't grow equally thick every year. And when the lakes freeze, they 
          now freeze gradually. 

          - The ice cover first starts to build up at shallow water and proceeds towards deeper sections from there on. 
            How fast the ice cover increases or decreases depends solely on the weather. Ice thickness can also vary at
            different sections of the lake. It's not anymore safe to walk on the ice as soon as there's ice cover on the
            lake. Thin ice can break under any load it can't hold - be it your character, NPCs, animals or items.

          - There's a confirmation to step on the ice if the character doubts the ice will hold. This applies to thin ice
            which characters can easily recognize by stomping on it to see if it cracks. Notice that even if there are no
            doubts and confirmations the ice still isn't necessarily safe to walk on.

          - It's not possible to travel on the ice on world map when the character doesn't trust the ice completely. 
            If that's the case a message to zoom in to travel on the ice will be shown. This way the character 
            can't mistakenly step on unreliable ice on world map. However, it should be noted that the ice can't 
            never be trusted completely and even when you are allowed to travel on the ice on world map it can still
            break. Should this happen, the character is forced on zoomed in map where he/she needs to navigate to
            safe location. 

        * falling through the ice

          - If you happen to fall through the ice climbing and pulling yourself back onto the ice is not easy and
            depends on your climbing skill, agility and strength. All of these factors are tested on each turn you try to 
            move from the water onto the ice. Wielding any sharp pointy weapon such as knife, sword, spear or even an arrow
            will improve your chances to pull yourself out of the water. Swimming skill is also important as it determines
            for how long and how easily you can keep struggling in the water. 

          - If you're unable to get out of the water after 5-10 minutes, you're almost certainly not going to get out.
            Your body temperature starts to drop as soon as you fall in the freezing water, and when hypothermia 
            sets in you will eventually lose consciousness and drown. Depending on your swimming and climbing skills
            you will also build up certain amount fatigue on every turn you spend struggling in the water, and the more 
            fatigued you get the lower your chances to pull yourself out become.

        * improved mechanics for making a hole in the ice

          - Time required to make a hole in the ice has been adjusted and now also depends on the ice thickness
            and the tool used. It's around 25 minute job to make a hole into half a meter thick ice
            with an axe. An inch thick ice can be broken in a minute or so. If the ice is very thin you can 
            also break it without any tools.

          - When making a hole in the ice the best available tool is automatically selected. In addition to axes, 
            spears and swords also stones and knives can be now used for breaking ice - even though they are quite
            unhandy for the job. The order of ice breaking tools from best to worst goes as: axe, spear, sword, 
            knife, stone. 

          - Holes in the ice will freeze back gradually and remain recognizable for a few days. Eventually
            the frozen holes will look like the regular ice cover, but may be weaker than the surrounding ice 
            for some time. As holes in the ice won't freeze completely overnight it's now easier to maintain
            your wintertime water supply by breaking the same slightly frozen hole on a regular basis with only
            a little effort.
        
        * water temperature 

          - Water temperature factor has been added, and it's precisely tracked thorough the year. It's not anymore 
            always pleasant nor possible to swim for equally long time just about any day of the year. 

          - Entering the water has faster effect on character's body temperature now. Even if you were feeling warm
            when going to swim in the cold water you'll get chilly or cold very soon. When the water is very warm
            you can spend hours in there without ill effects, but even if the lakes aren't frozen the water can still
            be so cold that there's a true risk of hypothermia. Needless to say, summer is best the season for longer 
            swimming trips from now on.

          - If you are about to enter the cold water there's now always a confirmation if you really want to do so.
            It's still safe to swim in the cold water, but now you just may need to warm up properly afterwards
            to get comfortable again. However, entering the cold water when you are already freezing is not a 
            wise move. 

          - When looking at an adjacent water tile a message about the water temperature will be displayed.
            "The water is freezingly cold.","The water is very cold.","The water is rather warm." etc.
	
 - improved: temperature checks, character's body temperature and effects of freezing temperatures 

        Temperature checks and their results to character's physique and body temperature are now tracked per minute.
        The curve at which character's body temperature now changes is smoother, more intelligent and more realistic. 

        * There's a new worst case character's body temperature tag added: "Freezing to death". Like the rest of tags, 
          it's shown in your "Nutrition/Warmth/Vigour" infobox and comes after the "Freezing" state. You should take the 
          new tag seriously as it informs about approaching lethal hypothermia. Actually, from now on you should take even
          the "Freezing" tag more seriously than before.
          The new, adjusted list of cold body temperature tags now goes as follows:         
          Cool, chilly, cold, bitterly cold, numbingly cold, freezing, freezing to death.

        * With the new body temperature checks and their minute based tracking it's now more likely and way faster to die 
          of hypothermia in the cold weather if you aren't dressed properly. Previously you could walk naked in the 
          freezing weather for hours just getting frostbites all over your body. If you try the same thing now it can 
          result in a death within mere half an hour or so.

        * Frostbites can still occur, but they are now more of nuisance rather than life-threatening risk. The death in the
          cold now comes with lowered body temperature which at it worst leads to state of hypothermia where you lose your 
          consciousness and freeze to death. And it can happen without a single frostbite. 
          It's best to take the warmth tags and cues of lowered body temperature seriously.

        * During extremely freezing temperatures it's now hardly avoidable to eventually feel cool, cold or chilly no matter 
          how many layers of fur you are wearing. Roaming days on end in the wild during the winter without occasionally 
          warming up by the fire is still sometimes manageable if you have lots of warm clothes, but it's no longer an 
          expedition of constant comfortable warmth.

 - added: frozen ground and related digging restrictions

        The ground can now get frozen along with freezing temperatures and this affects to possibilities
        of digging it. It's not possible to dig at all in completely frozen ground, and it's harder to dig 
        in somewhat frosty  ground. 
        When the ground first freezes and then melts again is based on average temperature of the 
        past few weeks. As a rule of thumb the ground gets frozen solid during the winter and starts to 
        melt again in the spring. Yearly variation can occur as this is based on the actual weather. 
        This adds a new factor to winter survival as you can't dig (trap) pits all year around anymore.

 - added: restrictions to planting and preparing the soil when the ground is frozen

        These actions don't depend merely on time of the year anymore, but are now linked to actual weather.  
        You can't plant anything or prepare the soil if it's still too cold or frosty. How early or late in
        the spring you can start growing your own crops now varies annually.

 - improved: weatherlore skill

	As we've got a new weather engine there are also new weatherlore results. The weather prediction
        is given for the next 24 hours and contains information about temperature changes and possibility
        of rain or snow. Using weatherlore skill before noon gives you a weather prediction for the ongoing
        day and the coming night. Using weatherlore skill after noon gives a prediction for the coming night
        and tomorrow day. 
        How accurately you can predict the weather naturally depends on your weatherlore skill.
        
	Examples of new weatherlore results:

	"During the night the temperature will be slightly colder than now. It will be raining. 
         Tomorrow the temperature will be about the same as now. It will be raining."

	"During the day the temperature will be slightly colder than now. It won't be snowing. 
         During the night the temperature will be slightly colder than now. It will be snowing a little."

 - overhauled: horizon box

	The "horizon box" in the upper left corner of the game view has been rewritten and refashioned. 
        Cloudiness, rain and snowfall are represented more beautifully with updated graphics.
        The sun sails across the sky based on realistic solar elevation angle the new weather engine provides. 
        Tint of the horizon box also changes according to time of the day and follows the day and night lighting cycle.
        Moreover, it's all updated on minute basis so everything that happens there now happens in more smooth and 
        precise fashion. 

 - added: new cursor drawing mechanics for selecting a target

        The new cursor is drawn more precisely along with map refresh on each move and makes it easier to figure out what tile 
        you've selected. However, it may appear slow on some systems and because of that there's FAST_TARGET_CURSOR configuration 
        option in urw_ini.txt to turn on old-school fast target cursor at will. 

 - added: texture scaling quality configuration option

        SCALE_QUALITY option in urw_ini.txt defines texture scaling quality as follows:
        0 - nearest pixel
        1 - linear
        2 - best

        It's set to 2 by default.

  - overhauled: map of know areas (F6)

	The outlook is familiar, but the content and options are enhanced and redesigned.

        * map viewport is larger than before and utilizes your current screen size. If you've got the resolution the 
          enlargened map view appears sharp and crisp.

        * cultural blocks are now round and alpha-blended on top of the map so that you get the idea of explored areas 
          also with cultural regions showing.

        * point and click locations for more information

          Hovering mouse cursor over the map brings up a target cursor and you can then point and click markers 
          and locations to see the associated information eg. village regional descriptions. 
          Clicking net and trap locations will show when you last visited those sites.
          
          It's also possible to choose and select locations with keyboard if you don't care to touch the mouse. 
          With keyboard you can toggle target selector on and off by pressing [F3], and then use arrows keys to 
          move and [ENTER] to select the location.

	* custom map markers

	  You can now add custom map markers with descriptive text. New markers can be added only at character's 
          current location, but editing and removing them anywhere on the map is possible regardless of character's 
          whereabouts. In addition to descriptive text you can also choose from five different marker colors. 

          Pointing and clicking a marker will show the associated description. When travelling on zoomed out 
          wilderness map the markers are clearly shown on when they come in your sight. You can also look at them
          on wilderness map to view the descriptive text.

          Markers are added and edited within Map Of Known Areas (F6) screen. To edit an already set marker 
          first point and click it. To add a new marker at character's location simply select [A]dd marker option.

 - music: new intro song, and music changes

        We've got a new intro song based on age-old traditional Kantele melody.
        5-string Kantele is played by Lani K. Thompson (www.kantelemusic.com).
        Arrangement, rest of the instruments, mixing and mastering by Sami. 

        The intro song now doesn't stop when the main is screen up but carries on until the actual gameplay
        gameplay starts, so it works as our character creation background music too.
         
        The previous outro and death tunes have been removed for variety of reasons. 

 - added: "How is it going?" chat option

        This is mostly a preliminary quest related addition to be featured in full force 
        in the upcoming versions. There are no quests yet and NPC replies to this question
        are short and trivial, except that old men may speak a little something about the weather.

 - modding add: true modability of crafted (and cooked) items

        Properties of crafted items can be modded so that truly new items can be created. This applies
        to do-it-yourself items (diy_*.*) and cookery recipes (cookery_*.*).

        Modding item properties is simple. You just add item property tags and preferred values after the actual
        crafting code. If you are creating completely new items it's still advisable to use similar vanilla item
        as a base item. Item property tags allow you to mod majority of item properties, but vanilla items may
        have some fixed values which is why it's important to choose the base item carefully.
        Eg. to create a new kind of a rope, base it on a vanilla rope to ensure it will be  properly recognized as
        tying equipment in the game. 

        Notice that modding item properties doesn't start from a scratch. Every crafted item already has its'
        properties initialized, and you just need to modify the ones you want to modify. When modding cooked item
        properties notice that the food price and nutritional values are always automatically calculated upon cooking. 

        Let's take a look at few examples. 
        Here we'll be crafting a new modded item "Custom javelin", which is based on vanilla Javelin:

        .Custom javelin. "Javelin" *COMMON* /30/
        {Staff} [remove]
        {Cutting weapon} <Axe>
        {Fire} '+(for hardening the head)'
        [POINT_ATTACK:8]
        [EDGE_ATTACK:-]
        [BLUNT_ATTACK:2]
        [WEIGHT:0.1]
        [PRICE:2]
        [1HPENALTY:5]

        We'll set point attack to 8, blunt to 2 and disable edge. We adjust the weight and price, and modify one-handed
        penalty for out custom javelin to 5%.


        Another example, a leather miniskirt:

        .Leather miniskirt. "Leather shirt" *COMMON* /60/
        {Leather} #2.5# [remove]
        {Knife}
        [ARMOUR_MATERIAL:leather]
        [ARMOUR_COVERAGE:hip groin]

        We base it on "Leather shirt" and then modify the coverage so the miniskirt covers only hip & groin. 


        And item modding is done the same way with cookery recipes. 
        Here's a recipe for dried berries:

        .Dried berries.     *COOKERY*	/25/ \10d\  %50%	 :151:  
        {Berries}   #1#     [remove] [roast] [name:Pile of dried %s]
        [SPOILAGE_DAYS:0]
        [WATER:0]
        [COOK_WEIGHT_DIV:10]

        We set spoilage time to zero which makes the food last forever, remove the possible water
        content in the berries, and use cooking specific weight divider tag to compress the food 
        weight to one tenth.

       
        Here's the list of item property tags you can use in modding items:
        ====================================================================================================================

        [NAME:] - item name

  	    Example:
	    [NAME:Weird knife] - The item is called weird knife in the game. 
                                 Notice .Item name. described in the header is still always shown in crafting menus, even
                                 if you will specify a name with this tag. 
                    
        
	***

	[TILEGFX:] - graphic tile filename for the item without the filename extension

	    Example:
            [TILEGFX:mytile] - the item uses truetile/mytile.png graphic tile.

        Tiles for the items need to be located in truetile/ folder in .png format.
        See truetile/readme.txt for more information about tile format.

        ***

        [TYPE:] - item type

            Possible values: weapon / armour / tool / container / skin / food / timber / vehicle / plant / valuable

	    Example: 
            [TYPE:weapon] - the item is a weapon

        ***

        [WEIGHT:] - weight in pounds (by default), or in grams if the value is followed by g abbreviation

	    Examples:
	    [WEIGHT:1.5]   - the item weighs 1.5 pounds
	    [WEIGHT:100 g] - the item weighs 100 grams

        ***

        [COOK_WEIGHT_DIV:] - a value to divide the cooked food weight with

            This is a special tag for cooked foods to allow them being compressed in weight but still keeping
            the total nutrional value intact. It's the same mechanism as the in-game drying of food items.

	    Examples:
	    [COOK_WEIGHT_DIV:2]   - the cooked food item weigh is halved (divided by two)
	    [COOK_WEIGHT_DIV:10]  - the cooked food item weigh is divided by ten (sets to 10% of the original)

        ***

        [CONT_CAPACITY:] - capacity of container type item in pounds

  	    Example:
	    [CONT_CAPACITY:3] - the container can hold 3 lbs of food, liquid etc.

        ***

        [PRICE:] - price in squirrel hides per item (default) or per pound if the value is followed by 'per lb'

            Examples:
            [PRICE:4]	      - the item costs 4 squirrel hides
            [PRICE:0.2]	      - the item costs 0.2 squirrel hides
            [PRICE:1.5 per lb] - one pound of the item costs 1.5 squirrel hides

        ***

        [EDGE_ATTACK:] 
        [POINT_ATTACK:] 
        [BLUNT_ATTACK:] - damage values for weapon attack aspects

            possible values: 0-9 or - 
            numbers define the damage, - means the aspect is not available for the weapon

            Example:
            [EDGE_ATTACK:0]
            [POINT_ATTACK:2]  
            [BLUNT_ATTACK:-] - thie weapon has 0 edge damage, 2 point damage and doesn't have blunt attack aspect

        ***

        [MATERIAL:] - of what raw-material the item is made of 

            This property is not fully functional yet and we'll be featured better in the future. However, it's advisable 
            to use this tag in your mods already.

            possible values: wood / iron / leather / fur / birch-bark / cloth / wool / rock / bone / antler

            Examples:
            [MATERIAL:wood]  - the item is wooden
            [MATERIAL:cloth] - the item is made of some cloth
            [MATERIAL:iron]  - the item is made of iron

        ***

        [ARMOUR_MATERIAL:] - material of armour type items. This defines the protection values.

            possible values: lamellar / iron / mail / leather / fur / cloth / wool / birch-bark

            Examples:
            [ARMOUR_MATERIAL:iron] - the armour is made of iron

        ***

        [ARMOUR_COVERAGE:] - bodyparts covered by the armour

            possible values: 
              one of these predefined coverage categories: 
                 cloak / hauberk / long_hauberk / habergeon / cuirass / overcoat / greaves / rerebraces / vambraces / 
                 shirt / short_shirt / long_shirt / trousers / tunic
              or any combination of these bodyparts values:
                 skull / face / neck / shoulder / upper_arm / elbow / forearm / hand / 
                 thorax / abdomen / hip / groin / thigh / knee / calf / foot

            Examples:
            [ARMOUR_COVERAGE:overcoat] 		  - the armour has coverage of an overcoat
            [ARMOUR_COVERAGE:skull neck shoulder] - the armour covers skull, neck and shoulders

        ***

        [SKILL:] - skill associated with the item. Only for weapons.
 
            possible value: one of the skills in the game eg. sword,club,bow,crossbow etc.

            Example:
            [SKILL:sword] - the weapon uses SWORD skill

        ***

        [1H_PENALTY:] - skill penalty from using this weapon one-handed

            possible value: 0-50, defaults to 0

     	    Example:
	    [1H_PENALTY:15] - 15% penalty is added when this weapon is used one-handed  

        ***

        [AD_CLASS:] - attack and defense class of the weapon. A/D classification adds related skill bonus when the
                      weapon is used in attack or defense.

            possible value: 0-6/0-6 (both values must be entered at once separated by /)

                            Default is 0/0. The higher the value the better the weapon performs in attack/defense.

	    Example:
            [AD_CLASS:5/0] - the weapon has attack class 5 and no bonus when used in defense
            [AD_CLASS:1/4] - the weapon has attack class 1 and defense class 4

        ***

        [SPOILAGE_DAYS:] - in how many days the food item spoils

            possible value: 0-253 (0 means that the item never spoils)

            Example:
            [SPOILAGE_DAYS:5] - the food item will spoil in 5 days

        ***

        [CARB:] 
        [FAT:] 
        [PROTEIN:] - nutritional values for food items per 100 grams of the food

            possible value: 0-99 representing grams of carbohydrates/fat/protein per 100 grams of the food

	    Example:
            [CARB:0]     - the item contains no carbohydrates
            [FAT:4]      - the item contains 4 g of fat (per 100 g)
            [PROTEIN:12] - the item contains 12 g of protein (per 100 g)

        ***

        [WATER:] - water content of food items per 100 grams

            possible value: 0-99 representing grams of water content 100 grams of the food

	    Example:
            [WATER:0]     - the item has no water content
            [WATER:50]    - the item contains 50 g of water (per 100 g)

        ====================================================================================================================

 - improved: examining locations

        * When looking at a location occupied by both NPC and items the information of items 
          is now also displayed. (Previously in such a situation only NPC information was displayed.)

        * When looking at non-empty location tile type information is now always displayed.
          For example, if there's a roasted cut on a sleeping bunk it will say:
           You see there a roasted cut.   
           Sleeping bunk
          (Previously tile type information was displayed only when looking at empty locations)

        * Examining a distant location ([l] or [F3]) now also displays precise track information if
          it's an unoccupied adjacent tile you are looking at. If you examine a further away location
          with visible tracks it just mentions that there are "some tracks".

 - added: unconscious creatures in the water will eventually drown
	
        On average it takes a minute or two (10-20 turns) for an uncoscious creature to drown in the
        water, and drowning can occur in the shallow water too. However, aquatic birds and animals don't 
        drown very easily even if they would lose consciousness in the water.

 - tweaked: food left to cook doesn't burn and spoil if the fire has gone out

 - added: information about how long a fire will burn 

        When examining a fire, you'll be given an estimation for how long it will burn. It's not an exact hour and
        minute information, but we use descriptions like:
        "This fire will burn for half an hour / an hour / over an hour / a few hours / several hours / etc. "
        If the fire is expected to burn for less than half an hour it's said to last "a (very) little while". 
        If the fire is expected to burn many, many hours then time of day descriptions are used in this fashion:
        "This fire will burn till evening / noon / early morning / etc." 

 - added: carrying lit torch or having a fire in adjacent tile helps to build a fire

 - improved: building a fire

        * Initial amount of required firewood to build a fire has been decreased so you can now 
          start smaller fires than previusly.

        * Some smaller kindling is always required to set larger pieces of wood on fire.

          You can't set for example trunks on fire anymore without having some branches, twigs, 
          firewood or other smaller combustible items there as well. Branches and firewood 
          can be always set on fire on their own, but pretty much everything larger than that 
          needs additional kindling. 

        * There are new game messages to notify about new firewood and kindling requirements.

 - adjusted: branch and spruce twig weights increased

        As a result lesser amount of them is needed for proper fire.

 - added: default inventory filtering for [w]ield command; only weapons & tools are listed by default
	
        It makes wielding of tools easier, as you don't have to browse the inventory that much.

 - improved: weapon restocking in villages

        Previously the weapon restocking was almost non-existent due to extremely long restocking cycle.
        Now the weapon restocking happens in more regular basis, even if the player character 
        wouldn't trade and reduce villagers weapon reserves at all. Weapon restocking is still
        rather slow and it can easily take months before weapon supplies in villages get renewed
        on their own. 
        Didn't find that bow you were looking for from a particular village in the autumn? 
        With the improved weapon restocking it's now actually worthwhile to come back in the winter 
        and they just might have it then.

 - added: asking people about their weapon skills

        Within "Ask for help/company" chat mode there's now an option to ask people about their
        weapon skills. 
        When recruiting companions those who need extra weapons will also automatically speak of their
        weapons skills. 

 - improved: recruiting companions

        If recruiting a companion is cancelled the people will give back the items you've given them.
        Just like previously, there's a chat option to cancel recruiting but now with appropriate 
        "Give my items back." remark. When already given items returned by NPC they are placed at 
        player's feet. In addition to continuing or cancelling companion recruiting via "Deliver" chat mode
        it can be now done also via "Ask for help/company" chat mode.

 - added: leashing animals from depopulated villages

        It's now possible to leash animals from depopulated villages, and thus make them your
        own pets. There are some risks and exceptions, though. Sometimes domestic animals choose to
        fight back if their masters are dead and you try to leash them. And dogs can't be
        stolen this way at all - they always fight back rather than allow to be put on the leash.

 - added: ABOUT dialog to start screen main menu

        It shows the general version information and your installation folder.

 - added: setup options menu

        Most common setup options can be now changed from in-game setup menu. 
        Editing urw_ini.txt remains for configuring more advanced options. 
        Setup menu can be accessed from the start screen and from the game itself through 
        newly added help and game options menu -> [ESC]. 
        Editing setup options through the menu changes contents of urw_ini.txt accordingly.
        You'll always have the same active configuration running regardless of how you do it.

 - added: help and game options menu - [ESC]

        List of keyboard commands, game encyclopedia, setup options, saving and quitting can be now activated
        through a single menu. This menu is accessed by pressing [ESC] in the main game view and it eases 
        newcomers troubles of memorizing keyboard commands or producing [?] symbol.

 - rearranged: list of keyboard commands [?] help page

        Outlook is fresh, list of commands is grouped a bit differently and the page can be scrolled
        also with mouse wheel. It also remembers the last position you were browsing.
        It's now hopefully a bit easier for newcomers to find and browse the commands.

 - added: hotkey to quickly save the character - [CTRL]+[s]
	
        Pressing CTRL+s saves the character and exits to main screen quickly and without confirmations.

 - added: when prompted to enter a number you can now type numbers also with numpad keys

        For example, when you're asked how many items to pick numpad cursor keys produce numbers.
        In all the other menus numpad keys move the selector.

 - added: dogs barking to warn of a danger and pets or companions crying in pain prompts to interrupt ongoing tasks

        TASK_ABORT_SOUNDS configuration option covers these new sound based task abort additions.

 - changed: auto zooming into your own settlement locates the character at where you last zoomed out

 - changed: Njerpezilis scimitar renamed as 'Njerpez scimitar'

 - changed: Kpllauta fox-trap renamed as 'Paw-board fox trap'

 - changed: DAGGER skill renamed as KNIFE

 - removed: SURVIVAL skill

        Actions that were covered by SURVIVAL skill are now remapped as follows:

        "Cut branches/twigs" is now done with TIMBERCRAFT skill. 
	"Shelter" can be built with BUILDING skill.
        "Make a hole in the ice" is now done with FISHING skill or [q]uaff command.
        "Build a fire" has a new [f] key command of its own

 - improved: [q]uaff command now also covers making holes in the ice

        If [q]uaff command is used when there's ice but no open water around you it will ask
        if you want to make a hole in the ice. This naturally works only on zoomed-in map.
        when making a hole in the ice any previously made partially frozen hole in your sight is
        automatically selected if available
	
 - added: [f] - a new key command to build a fire

 - added: alternate pick up keys: [g] and [G]

        In addition to [,] and [;] pick up keys these alternate keys can be used as well:
        [g] - pick up something
        [G] - pick up from adjacent tile

 - changed mechanics: going on shore by watercraft

	When travelling by watercraft you may now go on shore only on zoomed in map.

	There's message to inform you about it if you try to go on shore on world map.
        This fixes odd automatic watercraft placement attempts, and makes it more convenient to
        raft on world map as you don't have to worry about accidentally going on shore.

 - changed mechanic: zooming out at water based terrain

        It's not allowed to zoom out at water based terrain, unless you are travelling by watercraft.

        This means you need to move away from lake, river, rapids, sea etc. water based zoomed
        in maps before it is allowed to zoom back out to world map. You'll get accustomed to
        this quite soon, and often it's only a few steps you need to take to cross the map border
        onto dry land.
        This change was made to get rid of glitches which arose from game's attempts to automatically
        locate walking characters on dry land on the world map. When repeatedly visiting zoomed
        in terrain beside the water, returning exactly from where you last zoomed out also works
        better without the world map relocation hassle.

 - added: broad knife is now preferred tool in hideworking
		
	Broad knife is the best and preferred tool in skinning carcasses and cleaning hides.
        Northern knife, hunting knife and kaumolais knife - in this order - are the second best tools for
        hideworking jobs. 

 - added: stone knife - a new craftable weapon

        It's an awkward knife, but a knife nevertheless. Stone knife can be crafted with two rocks -
        one for blade, one for knapping. 

 - added: broken arrows

	When arrows break they don't just disappear anymore as there's now a broken arrow item.
	Broken arrows aren't useful or weapons at all, but just firewood. 

 - adjusted: bowshooting accuracy of skilled bowmen

        Skilled bowmen are now slightly more accurate. Nothing radical, just some fine tuning. 

 - adjusted: battleaxe properties

        The earlier battleaxe type and its' description and properties were of an anachronistic fantasy weapon.
        Several changes have been made and now battleaxe in the game represents a long-shafted viking battleaxe
        which were single bladed, carefully balanced and relatively light weapons:
        
        - battleaxes are now lighter than previously, weighing around around 3.5 lbs. 
        - battleaxes don't have point attack aspect anymore - the earlier fantasy battleaxe had a spike in the head
        - long-shafted battleaxes are still two-handed weapons but penalty from one-handed use now lesser than previously
        - game encyclopedia (F1) entry about battleaxes has been updated.
	
 - adjusted: descriptions of parts of the day 
	
	There are a few new tags, and this is how it goes now:

        12 pm        Noon
        13 pm        Early afternoon
        14 pm-15 pm  Afternoon
        16 pm-17 pm  Late afternoon
        18 pm        Early evening
        19 pm-20 pm  Evening
        21 pm        Late evening
        22 pm        Night
        23 pm        Late night    
        00 am        Midnight
        1 am-2 am    After midnight
        3 am-5 am    Small hours
        6 am         Early morning
        8 am         Morning
        10 am-11 am  Late morning

 - changed: 'laced leather shoes' replaced with 'leather boots'
 
        The item name here was odd and unclear and is now changed. Leather boots cover feet and calves, 
        just like the laced leather shoes did. 

 - corrected: weight of shoes and boots

	Shoes were too light. A pair of leather shoes now weigh 2 lbs. A pair of boots weigh 3.2 lbs.

 - corrected: knife weights

        All the knives were too heavy. This has been corrected and knives now weigh from 100 grams (small knife) 
        to 180 grams (northern knife). Skaramasaksi weighs around 1.2 pounds.

 - fixed [windows]: system beep when using [ALT]+key

        This was SDL2 issue, which should be history now with new SDL2 version in use.

 - fixed/tweaked: foreign traders loitering at zoomed-in areas indefinitely

        Foreigners will now leave zoomed-in areas usually within 5-10 days from their arrival. 

 - fixed: linen, nettle and woollen items not burning 

 - fixed: "command" chat option to tell people to leave your settlement was broken

        Now you can command wandering people to leave your settlement if need be.

 - fixed: player character getting located inside animal pens upon entering a village

 - fixed: companion accepted weight limit

        It was bugged and companions accepted less items than what they could actually carry. 
        Fixed now and we shouldn't bump into "Sorry, it's too much for me carry." nagging that often.

 - fixed: mushroom default nutritional values

        Mushrooms default nutritional values (per 100g) are now: carbs 3g, protein 2g, fat 1g

 - fixed: treeless lanes at borders of zoomed-in maps

 - fixed: foods not spoiling at all if you visited the storage location rarely enough

 - fixed: tracks not appearing on snow covered base rock or crag tiles 

 - fixed: prone enemies could hit to any body location

        Now prone enemies can hit you only to lower part of the body, mostly the legs.

 - fixed: character's latest body temperature status not remembered correctly upon entering the game

 - fixed: beaver's diving status occasionally persisting when they get out of the water

        This resulted in invisible beavers walking around.

 - fixed: diving creatures mistakenly triggering notification about something entering your sight - even though
          you actually can't see them

 - fixed: wilderness map glitch of picked items sometimes appearing again after zooming in and returning

        This was a very rare condition, but caused occasional one-time duplication of items that were 
        dropped and picked up on the wilderness map.

 - fixed: 'place for soaking' crafting requirement wasn't properly recognized when carrying a carcass

 - fixed: trapped birds occasionally being able to fly (for a very brief moment)

 - fixed: map maintenance occasionally failing to free any map space 

        This resulted in frequent maintenance tries on every map load with no real progress.

Version: 3.20 (patch 2)
Released: 17-Mar-2015

Scroll down for complete changelog for version 3.20 (stable). 
These are the fixes/additions in patch 2 for version 3.20:

 - added: new winter photos for coniferous forest, spruce mire and grove terrain types

 - balanced & overhauled: TRAPPING related animal spawning 

        What hasn't changed is that your TRAPPING skill determines the success of constructing and setting traps. 
        Badly set or badly made traps may scare off animals, fail to keep animals properly trapped or appear
        not attractive enough for animals to enter them. These are the common trapping rules. 
        In short, higher the TRAPPING skill the more easily animals enter your traps and more reliably they 
        stay trapped.

        What has changed is the spawning mechanism.
        Previously there was a system which caused succesfully set traps to spawn animals at the area. This 
        happened in very unbalanced fashion and resulted in far too many animals to be spawned far too
        close to the traps - and in far too great number.
        This unbalanced spawning mechanism is now removed and attractiveness of traps is replaced with a
        new and more delicate system.

        As straightforward spawning of animals is removed, the harsh simplicity of trapping goes as follows:
        If there are animals at the area they may enter your traps depending on how succesfully these 
        traps are set or constructed. If there aren't animals at the area your traps will remain empty. 
        However, if there weren't animals at the area today the situation may not be the same after a couple
        of days. Traditional method of relying on the same traps at chosen trapping grounds for a longer
        period of time and checking them out on a regular basis is still valid and suitable trapping method.

        Moreover, there's a new delicate mechanism which furthermore improves propability of catching animals
        with traps:

        * Even if animals at the area wouldn't be actually hungry, properly baited and succesfully set traps
          may attract them beyond regular feeding needs. 

        * Succesfully set traps may trigger additional animal population checks for appropriate animals

          This is different from straightforward animal spawning and works more like an increased propability
          of new animal populations to be created at the area. This mechanism follows the rules of general
          animal population creation, so commonness and relative number of animals and their natural habitats
          are carefully taken into account. Therefore, if the trapped area is not suitable for a certain 
          animals or if animal populations are on a good natural level, no trap can cause extra population
          propability. 

        To succeed in trapping now it takes more patience, careful consideration and knowledge of animals
        natural habitats. Setting traps at areas where you have actually noticed marks of wildlife is often
        most effective. Nevertheless, knowing that bears can occupy spruce mires and setting bear traps at
        spruce mires even in random fashion may still prove succesfull.
        You can expect less catches with traps now, but it will be far more rewarding when it happens.     

 - speed optimized: map drawing when passing time with NPCs in sight

        Map drawing is optimized so that redraw occurs only if NPC locations do actually change.
        This way NPCs who are in sight but standing still do not cause extra lag to passing time.
        Passing time with standing still companions and pets in sight is now just as fast as
        with no-one in sight. 
        If there's NPC movement in sight more frequent map redraws naturally slows things down,
        but most often passing time is a lot faster now.

 - improved: map drawing and scaling

        Map rendering is now texture-based and looks sharp and crisp on higher resolutions - even
        with fully zoomed out map view.

 - "loading map..." box has its' color changed and is relocated a bit lower on the screen

 - added: new effects for zooming between world and terrain map

        Rectangular zoom in/out "effect" is removed.
        Map view is shaded with a slight color tint when zooming in/out.
        Terrain pictures are faded in and zoomed onto screen.
        After the world or terrain map is loaded alpha blending transition is used in switching
        the map view.

 - added: new map fade effects when falling asleep or losing consciousness

        These aren't nothing too fancy, just fading and blending the map view to a single color,
        but the effects are renderer blends in SDL 2 fashion and look way smoother than previously.
        Moreover, there are different fade colors for different situations.
        Falling asleep fades into midnight blue color, losing consciousness fades into bloodred color.
        Waking up and recovering consciousness also features a smooth fade back to the map view.

 - added: option to go prone intentionally

        Hotkey [u] now toggles between standing and laying down, and option to lay down is also 
        available in "movement and rest actions" menu. This allows your character to go prone
        intentionally. Being prone has use in avoiding getting hit by enemy arrows. Prone target is 
        smaller target and therefore more challenging to hit from a distance with missile weapons.
        But you should NOT count on never getting struck by an arrow when prone. 

 - added: vision restrictions when prone

        Character's line of sight is calculated differently when prone. Even the slight slopes 
        do restrict the sight of prone characters.

 - improved: archery from behind an obstacle

        Arrows won't ever hit the adjacent obstacle when shooting from behind it.

 - added: new key commands to eat and pass a turn

        * lower case [e] now works, and is the official key command to eat

          Upper case [E] works as well for convenience of those who have gotten used to it. 

        * keypad 5 works as an alternative key to pass a turn 

          This is equal to pressing [.] key to pass a turn.

 - improved: HERBLORE inventory filtering

        Using HERBLORE to examine plants in your inventory now automatically filters for plants
        and foods.

 - added: key commands to wield picked up items automatically - [CTRL]+[,] and [CTRL]+[;]

        Press [CTRL] together with pick up commands [,] or [;] to automatically wield picked up items. 
        Notice that when picking up multiple items this way the first selected items on the list will
        be wielded.

 - changed: warmth is excluded from calculations in the display of average armour protection

 - changed: [ESC] equals to "Yes" in [Yes]/[No] prompts to abort tasks 

        For example, when you are prompted to abort a task because of hearing sounds or noticing 
        creatures pressing [ESC] equals to "Yes, I want to abort this task."

 - changed: wording in aiming zone penalty descriptions "challenging" -> "tricky"

        Aiming zone penalties are now described as "tricky" or "difficult". "TrickY" being easier
        than "Difficult".

 - fixed: numlock hassle - it's now always off in the game

        NumLock is now forced permanently off and numeric keypad produces only movement signals -
        not numbers. This prevents the numlock hassle arising from SDL 2 bug, and also helps
        newcomers to get playing without having to care about NumLock state.

 - fixed: projectiles being told to hit slopes when shooting/throwing at creatures in the water 

        This was a mostly a wrong message issue, but water shot/throw aiming angle also needed
        few adjustments. 

 - fixed: foreign traders not staying in group 

        Their "herding" behaviour was broken. Now foreigners wander around more close to each others.

 - fixed: spoiled food was just as nutritious as normal edible food

        Spoiled food is now only half as nutritious as normal edible food.

 - fixed: zero population settlements aka ghost villages

        Old randomization fault which caused the smallest settlements occasionally appear completely
        empty of people. 

 - fixed: wrong message when trying to swim from a watercraft while rowing prone

        The game said 'You can't swim while lying down.' and now properly says 'You can't swim while rowing.'

 - fixed: Warfare game-course task getting completed also by killing other than Njerpez NPCs

 - fixed: butchering carcass twice

        Double fat and extra cuts were occasionally obtained from already butchered carcasses. 

 - fixed: sleeping birds occasionally getting flying status; "sleeping flying bird"

 - fixed: nonaquatic birds exploring water areas; flying too far away from the shore

 - fixed: sleeping character could select a defense maneuver upon being hit

Version: 3.20 (patch 1)
Released: 14-Jan-2015

Scroll down for complete changelog for version 3.20 (stable). 
These are the fixes/additions in patch 1 for version 3.20:

 - fixed: keyboard issues; ignored keypresses and non-responsive keyboard state

 - fixed: noisy audio (due to audio initiliazation with low sample rate)

 - fixed: emptying once paid containers made them unpaid again

 - fixed/changed: having to pay for using water in villagers containers 

        If you filled your own containers from unpaid tubs of water or utilized water in unpaid 
        tub in any other way you had to pay for it. This also often resulted in bugged debt lists.

 - fixed: wild animals trying to snatch food close to the player character

 - fixed: trapped animals triggering adjacent traps, and leaving them "in use" state

        This was fixed in 3.20 already but some conditions of the bug still persisted.

 - fixed: using high quality weapons in butchering small animals sometimes resulted in obtaining more meat 
          than the carcass weighed

 - fixed: wrong northern spear sprite

        wrong sprite persists with migrated northern spears. The fix applies to new items.

 - fixed: knees missing from overcoat coverage

        Overcoats now cover the knees.
        wrong coverage persists with migrated overcoats. The fix applies to new items.

 - fixed: faulty messages about NPCs unwielding odd items

 - fixed: pet dogs giving up the chase if their prey entered water

 - fixed: walls of sauna stoves appearing within villages/fields

 - fixed: crash potential when entering single house Reemi settlements

 - fixed: a rare condition of dogs choosing a random target after loosing their original prey

 - fixed: villagers labeling you as a thief if you pushed items while carrying unpaid items

 - fixed: being able to [D]iscard village property

 - fixed: inventory filtering of unpaid items listed the items in multiple same item categories

 - fixed: manually returned unpaid items which NPCs couldn't carry became unpurchaseable

 - fixed/changed: splinting the fractures in head area

        Fractures in eye sockets, neck and skull are now treated with bandages and compresses.

 - fixed: a rare condition of corrupt population data causing empty villages getting restocked 

 - fixed: feathers dropping from skinned bird carcasses (if they were eaten by an animal)

 - fixed: using a crossbow could mistakenly train BOW skill too

 - fixed: starting location not renewed after re-randomizing the map during character creation

 - fixed [linux]: *.txt files in installation directory were symlinked files 

 - fixed [linux]: unnecessary (and faulty) libc.so.6 dependency removed 

 - changed: birds and bigger animals do not enter cellars anymore

        Only relatively small carnivores such as foxes, polecats and ermines may occasionally
        manage to snatch food from cellar. 

 - added: unconcious/dead seals can sometimes fall to the bottom of the sea rather than resurface

 - added: configuration option for auto zooming into your settlements

        AUTO_ENTER_HOMESTEAD option in urw_ini.txt defines if you want to automatically zoom in
        when moving onto your settlement tile on world map.
        Possible values are YES and NO. It's set to YES by default.

 - added: configuration option for overall audio volume

	VOLUME option in urw_ini.txt defines the overall audio volume. 
        The value can be from 1 to 100, with 100 representing 100% volume. It's set to 50 by default.

 - added: being able to swim from watercraft

        Use your SWIMMING skill when not wielding paddle or sesta to go swimming from the watercraft.

Version: 3.20 (stable)
Released: 22-Dec-2014

** Saved characters from version 3.18-> are compatible with this version. **


 - SLD 2 migration accomplished - freely resizable game window, compatibility and future 
         possibilities 

        UrW now uses SDL 2, SDL_image 2 and SDL_mixer 2 libraries. Migration to SDL 2 is 
        necessary to allow bigger graphics overhaul to take place in the future and to remove
        several bottlenecks and compatibility problems in handling the keyboard and graphics.

        From developer's point of view SDL 2 migration stands as an investment for the future.

        From player's point of view the three most notable changes from moving to SDL 2 are:

        * Game window is now freely resizable. (But otherwise there are no changes in 
          graphics or screen layout.)
        * Variety of graphic initialization and full screen problems are history.
        * Keyboard layout related problems (eg. DVORAK) are history. 

        There are few issues with SDL 2 which you should be aware of:

        - In Windows a chime sound is played when using ALT+key combinations (skill hotkeys)
          if you have Windows sounds enabled. 
        - The game needs to be started with NumLock off or otherwise numpad cursor keys 
          are not working. 
        - Keyboard repeat rate is derived directly from system repeat rate, so keyboard
          response is probably a bit different compared to version 3.19.

 - added: configuration options to set preferred resizing and fullscreen modes  
	
        LOGICAL_RESIZE option in urw_ini.txt defines if the logical size and aspect ratio 
        should be maintained upon resizing the window or not. 
        Possible values are YES and NO. It's set to YES by default.

        FULLSCREEN option in urw_ini.txt defines if the game is started in normal,
        maximized or fullscreen window. 
        Possible values are:
        NO         - normal resizable game window. Starts at last used game window size.
        YES        - fullscreen game window at the current desktop resolution.
        MAXIMIZED  - game window is maximized upon starting the game.

 - setup menu removed - everything is now configured via urw_ini.txt

        All the configuration options are now set by editing urw_ini.txt in the installation 
        folder. The actual setup menu has been removed from the main game-screen, but setup 
        selection remains only to display info to go edit urw_ini.txt. 
        
        Self-explanatory setup menu options now appear urw_ini.txt as follows:

        AUDIO, BACKGROUND_MUSIC, AMBIENT_SOUNDS, MOVEMENT_SOUNDS, IDLE_ANIMATION 

 - added: scandinavian letters allowed in character names

        In character folder names scandinavian letters are encoded to hex values.
       
 - changed: character loading menu shows true names of the characters

        Previously it showed (the first 8 letters of) character folder names.

 - added: an incomplete list of credits to main menu
	
 - added: true crop cycle for villages - harvesting, stocking and sowing
	
        All the villages now properly harvest their fields, stock the products and sow the
        fields again in the spring. Villages start harvesting the crops as soon as majority of
        plants have ripened, and continue until everything has been harvested. 
        Start of the harvest season is first noticed by bundles of turnips appearing in the villages,
        followed by peas, and then beans and grains. 

        Pod type plants are stored in bags, root vegetables are just stocked somewhere on their
        own and seeds are stored in boxes and baskets. Notice that not all the containers are necessarily 
        completely full. Availability of farm products and seeds in villages is naturally most abundant 
        in autumn, reserves will be consumed during the winter, and there's usually only little left in
        the spring. And yes, you can now also get seeds from the villages.  
        
        Crop cycle is maintained year after year if there's sufficient population in the village.

 - added: two new containers - birch-bark box and birch-bark basket

        * birch-bark box
        
          Light and small container which villagers use for storing small seeds. It can hold 1 lbs.  
          There's a separate graphic tile for this item:
          truegfx/sp_sbox.png
          (tile drawn by Brian Shapiro)
 
        * birch-bark basket
        
          Rather large container which villagers use for storing big seeds. It can hold 15 lbs.  
          There's a separate graphic tile for this item:
          truegfx/sp_sbasket.png
          (tile drawn by Brian Shapiro)

  - adjusted: container capacities

        Wooden tub can now hold 10 lbs. (was 8 lbs)
        Bag can now hold 20 lbs. (was 10 lbs)
        Wooden bowl can now hold 6 lbs. (was 4 lbs)
        Wooden cup can now hold 3 lbs. (was 2 lbs)

        MIGRATION NOTICE:
        These factors only apply to newly created items. Containers that were created in earlier versions
        have the old capacities.

 - added: proper empty container weights and load calculations

        Containers didn't really have their own effective empty weights and attempts to calculate true 
        loads of filled or emptied containers were confusing and failed. Now containers have proper empty
        weights and load calculations are working properly.

        MIGRATION NOTICE:
        These factors only apply to newly created items. Containers that were created in earlier versions
        probably now have zero empty weight.

 - balanced and checked: farm product values 

        No changes in grain price.
        Root vegetables prices have been doubled.
        Pod type plant (beans and peas) prices are increased by 50%.
        Flour value has been halved, and it's now about 50% more valuable than the grains itself.
        Small seeds, such as turnip seeds, aren't considered very valuable and have a low nominal price. 
        All the foodstuff prices are foremostly based on their true nutritional value, but these few 
        adjustments give better balance to relative prices of these farm products.

 - adjusted: seed weights

        Turnip seeds, and other small seeds, are now lot more lighter than previously. 
        There are some balancing in pea and grain weighs too, but those aren't dramatic. 

 - changed: your character won't butcher human corpses unless somewhat starved

        This ends an era of lightly practised cannibalism and trade of human flesh.

 - changed: wearing armours

        You can wear multiple textile, leather or fur clothes of the same type at the 
        same time. For example: you can wear fur shirt, linen shirt and nettle shirt
        at the same time. Metal armour restrictions remain unchanged - only one piece of 
        each armour type.  

 - overhauled: armour glossary

        Anachronistic armours removed, new armours & clothes added, coverages checked & adjusted, 
        new sprites added, and armour availability & usage checked and adjusted.

        MIGRATION NOTICE:
        With migrated characters armour attribute changes (names, sprites, properties) don't apply
        to old items that were created/obtained in previous version. 

        * terminology changes

          Greaves are now known as shin guards.
          Vambraces are now known as forearm guards.
          Short hauberk is now simply known as hauberk. 
          Long cowl is now simply known as cowl.

        * new sprites

          There are new sprites for helms, metal cowl, hauberk, bandage, mittens, generic 
	  cowl/veil/headgear, generic trousers/leggings and generic spot protection armour.
          (original tiles drawn by Brian Shapiro - some are modified)

          To allow compatibility with modded tilesets there are separate files for new sprites
          in truegfx/ folder: 
          sp_mhaub, sp_lhaub, sp_helm, sp_spechelm, sp_mittens, sp_headgear, sp_mcowl,
          sp_headgear, sp_bandage, sp_spotprot, sp_trousers

        * ring armours removed - all of them.

          Ring type armour has no base in history. No actual examples of ring armour have
          been found on European archaeological findings. 

        * variety of anachronistic iron armours removed

          Iron great helm, iron halfhelm, iron cuirass, iron breastplate, iron greaves, 
          iron vambraces and iron rerebraces are removed. 

        * helms 

          There are two types of helms, both made of iron: helm and spectacle helm. 

          - Helm covers the skull and is made from one piece of iron hammered into shape.
          - Spectacle helm covers the skull and face. It has a spectacle-like covering for the face, 
            extending down to wearer's chin. 

        * new armour material: lamellar

          Lamellar is eastern armour type used by Njerpez. Lamellar armours are made of square
          or rectangular iron plates tightly fastened to each other with leather straps passed 
          through openings along the edges of the plates. Lamellar technique is used mainly to create
          cuirass and hauberk type armors, but it's also suitable for some spot protection pieces.
          Compared to mail, lamellar armour offers better protection from blunt attacks but only 
          slightly better protection from edged attacks.

          There are 5 lamellar armour items:
          lamellar hauberk, lamellar cuirass, lamellar forearm guards, lamellar shin guards and
          lamellar rerebraces
 
        * new leather armours

          There are 3 new leather armours items which all can be crafted:
          leather shin guards, leather forearm guards and leather cuirass

        * hauberk coverage adjustments

          Hauberk (previously known as short hauberk) doesn't cover upper arms anymore.
          This is because there was no really relevant difference between the two hauberk types. 
          (Long hauberk covers the upper arms and extends to the knees.)

        * undershirts shortened

          Undershirts now extend to the thighs. (Previously to the knees)
 
        * dresses lengthened

          Women's dresses now extend to the calves, but don't anymore cover upper arms. 
          (Previously they covered also the upper arms and extended to the thighs)

        * overcoats lengthened

          overcoats now extend all the way to the knee. 

        * fur cloth changes and additions

          - Fur mittens are now longer than they used to be and now cover also the forearms.
            (Previously they covered only hands)

          - Fur shirt is now shorter than it used to be. 
            It's still long-sleeved shirt but extends only to cover the groin and hips. 
            (Previously it covered also the thighs and knees)

          - new fur item: fur overcoat 

            Long-sleeved and long coat extendeding down to your knees. Can be crafted and is a useful
            piece of winter clothing. More valuable, heavier and requires more raw material than a 
            fur shirt.

        Foreign traders and Njerpez now have a distinctive cultural difference between armours they
        favour and wear. In general metal armours are very rare, and even the foreign warriors need to 
        rely mostly on fur and leather for protection. Helms, cowls and smaller metal armours for spot 
        procetion are now far more common than valuable body armours such as hauberks.

        Wealthy local cultures of Driik, Sartola, Koivula and Reemi may very rarely have
        few metal armours available. These are often helms and pieces of spot protection, 
        and only extremely rarely body armours. 

 - balanced: stocking and availability of some basic tools
        
        Basic tools such as pots, ropes, sickles and shovels are now more commonly
        found even among isolated cultures. Availability of the tools is naturally
        culturally dependent, but you don't necessarily have to go to western villages
        anymore to find a pot or shovel. Villages now stock also empty wooden containers
        such as wooden tubs and bowls.

 - added: villages stock wood and lumber

        You can now find boards, slender tree trunks, wooden stakes and logs in villages.
        Availability of these items is naturally culturally dependant.

 - added: villages stock ordinary clothes

        All except northern cultures may occasionally have some spare clothes available
        in their villages. Availability of clothes is dependant on village wealth and 
        population, but there's a possibility to find all kind of ordinary clothes;
        linen, woollen, nettle and fur clothes- and even shoes or women's dresses.

 - balanced: availability of high quality of northern bows

        Northern people can now have high quality (fine and masterwork) bows - their
        availability was broken in previous version. These items are still rare, but
        can be found. Especially Kuikka-tribe people are the master bow makers of the
        north.

 - added: one new character portrait (to eastern portraits)
       
 - added: "Stop your tasks" companion command

        This makes your companion to stop all the tasks he/she was doing.

 - added: group commands for pets and companions

        You can now give group commands to your pets and companions eg. to make them
        all attack the same target at once.

        * group commands for pets

          Group command mode can be activated after you've chosen to talk or shout to one
          of your dogs. If there are multiple dogs within sight or hearing range "Group 
          command" selection appears in animal commands menu. After you've activated it
          the command you then choose will be given to all the dogs in range. 
          'Eat' and 'Attack' are possible group commands for dogs. Eat command still requires 
          first talking to a dog in your sight.

        * group commands for companions

          Group command mode can be activated after you've chosen to talk to one of your
          companions. If there are multiple companions within a close range "Group 
          command" selection appears in companions commands menu. After you've activated it
          the command you then choose will be given to all the companions in range. 
          'Attack', 'Fell trees', 'Make a fire' and 'Stop your tasks' are possible group 
          commands for companions.

 - added: an option to ask NPCs what they want in a trade

        There's now "What of my items you'd prefer in this trade?" chat option available
        during trading. Upon using it NPCs will let you know the items they prefer, or 
        how they feel about the trade in general. Regardless of what they say you can still
        offer any items you want, but usually their thoughts and wishlists are good and
        fair advises. 

 - balanced: robber demands and speaking them out

        * You can now ask robbers what items they want exactly. This helps to decide whether
          you really want to hand over your goods or not.

        * Robbers demands have been reasoned and can vary

          In general robbers now prefer value and quality over quantity. Even if you a had
          lots of gear with you robbers are usually satisfied with a dozen of most precious
          ones. Most importantly they don't want to rob all of your clothes and armours
          anymore, but only the most valuable ones. There's also variation in robber's 
          demands and some can be happy with only a few very valuable items.

 - added: seals!

        There are two types of seals: the ringed seal and the grey seal.
        Both live in the sea and can be found on all the coastal regions of the UnReal World. 
        The grey seal is more common than the ringed seal. 
        (In reality certain subspecies of ringed seals should exists in big lakes of Kiesse too,
         but adding them stays for later.)

        Seals spend most of their days in the water but do regularly come ashore to rest
        and pass time in certain locations. During open water season they rest on rocky surfaces
        of the utmost skerries and islets of the sea. In the winter they do live near the edge
        of the ice, spending the lazy hours on the ice. 

        For more information about the seals see game encyclopedia entries [F1] for RINGED SEAL
        and GREY SEAL. 

        * Meat yield from seals is very low compared to their weight, but their fat yield is
          high.

        * Seal-tribe village restocking has been adjusted to feature a proper level of seal
          furs and meat.

        To allow compatibility with modded tilesets there's a separate sprite files for seals:
        truegfx/av_gseal.png, truegfx/av_rseal.png

 - added: aquatic animals can dive under the water 

        They do it especially when escaping. As diving animals disappear from your sight they
        are pretty much impossible to be hunted while diving.

 - added: feathers

        Skinning a bird now also gives you its' feathers. Number of feathers obtained depends 
        on the bird size and ranges roughly from 12 to 100. It's assumed that you want to keep
        only the good wing and tail feathers.
        
        * You can also find naturally dropped feathers.

        * Feathers are categorized as tools.
        
        * Crafting an arrow now requires three feathers per arrow. Crafting a blunt arrow now
          also requires tying equipment as the feathers need to be attached to the shaft.

        To allow compatibility with modded tilesets there's a separate sprite file for feathers:
        truegfx/sp_feather.png

 - added: new birds

	Raven, goshawk, hazel grouse, kuikka, goldeneye, willow grouse and eagle owl.

        Find briefing of the new birds below and see their game encyclopedia [F1] entries 
        for more info.

        * Raven 

  	  Ravens prefer extensive areas of forest and exist throughout UnReal World in rather 
          scarce number. They are mainly scavengers feeding on carcasses of dead animals, but
          their diet may also vary widely and ravens can be considered quite omnivorous.

        * Goshawk

          Goshawks are strongly built hawks. They nest in older forests throughout UnReal World
          and hunt other birds and small mammals, sometimes as large as hares. Goshawks are
          migratory birds, leaving in late autumn and returning in spring.

        * Eagle owl

          The eagle owl is a very large owl. They have large heads with striking ear tufts and
          fiercely glowing orange-coloured eyes. Eagle owls breed in scarce number in forests
          almost throughout UnReal World, except for the unforested mountainous areas of the
          extreme north. Eagle owls are birds of prey and hunt hares, small mammals and birds. 
          They are active at night and very efficient hunters.

        * Willow grouse

          Medium-sized and least numerous of all the forest game birds, but nevertheless found 
          all around UnReal World and commonly hunted for meat. Willow grouse can thrive in
          very diverse terrain, but primarily occupies sparse pine forests, mires and slopes
          of cliffs and fjells. They are accustomed to cold, harsh and rugged environment, but
          favour having birch and alder trees around their territory.

        * Hazel grouse

          The smallest and the second most common forest game birds found in Unreal World. 
	  Adults mate in early spring and nest on the ground. 
          They prefer thick forests with both conifers and leaf trees.
          In thick forests hazel grouses can survive better from goshawks.

        * Goldeneye

          Common aquatic birds breeding around inland and marine waters. 
          Goldeneyes are migratory birds. They leave in autumn and are among the first migratory
          birds to return in early spring.

        * Kuikka

          Kuikka is a rather large aquatic bird named after its' distinctive call. 
          Kuikka breeds throughout Unreal World by wilderness lakes with clear water. 
          It eats fish, typically perch and roach. Kuikkas are migratory birds, leaving quite
          early in autumn and returning in spring. 

        To allow compatibility with modded tilesets there are separate sprite files birds:
        truegfx/av_goshawk.png etc.

 - added: audio samples for birds

        Now we can actually hear ravens, goshawks, swans, kuikkas, hazel grouses and eagle 
        owls calling.

        How talkative the birds are depends on the species and time of the year. 
        Hazel grouses are most talkative in the spring and late summer, eagle owls call almost
        exclusively n the winter, kuikkas keep calling mostly during early summer season etc. 

 - added: birds lay eggs

        All the ground nesting birds now lay eggs. Depending on the species eggs are laid in 
        Swidden month (April), Seedtime month (June) or Fallow month (July). Aquatic birds
        lay eggs on islets and skerries, or nearby the shore among vegetation, and finding
        their eggs is relatively doable if you have patience. Eggs of forest birds are much
        harder to find. 

        Of the forest birds capercaillie, black grouse, willow grouse and hazel grouse all
        nest on the ground. 

        (Traditionally mostly the eggs of ground nesting birds have had importance to eke
         out diet. Eggs of tree nesting birds is a curiosity that was intentionally left out
         this time.)

 - overhauled: animal populations

        Creation of animal populations has been thoroughly checked, adjusted and balanced. 
        These adjustments concern not only the commonness and relative number of animals, but
        also their natural habitats. Frequency of big game remains quite the same as it was,
        and most notable changes are seen in populations of small animals and birds.

        In general you can now expect more varied and greater number of wildlife to exist in
        the world, but natural habitat of animals has a much greater role than before. You 
        can't expect to find any forest animals in any type of forest. 

        Few examples:
        Gluttons and ravens prefer large intact coniferous woodland areas. 
        And so do pine-martens - but they also like cliffs and caverns nearby their home
        forests. Badgers mostly occupy mixed or leaf tree forests - preferably with some 
        wetlands nearby. Weasels aren't too picky about their habitat as long as there's enough
        trees and vegetation to provide coverage - but they tend to avoid too open areas.
        etc. etc. etc.

        With balanced and overhauled animal populations in use you are bound to find more
        animals and more different species within smaller area than before.  It's possible
        that an area of 5x5 wilderness tiles (500x500 meters) can have a dozen of different
        forest birds, three hares, two squirrels, a fox and a badger around. It's possible - 
        but naturally not always the case. And despite of more wildlife existing it's not
        evident that you'll get to spot it from a close (or hunting) distance. 
        
        To learn more about changes in habitat and population adjustments see updated 
        game encyclopedia [F1] pages for:

        * ARTIC FOX

          Even though artic foxes are most common in the north they can be now met also
          elsewhere. Even back in 1800's arctic foxes have been said to be somewhat common
          in southern Finland so we assume that some populations have wandered and existed 
          all around UnReal World. NPCs of other than northern cultures can now also stock
          artic fox furs. 

 - changed: arrows are now slightly more valuable (because of feathers in the mix)


 - added: all cutting weapons work for cutting carcassess - but knife is preferred

        You get fewer cuts from the carcass when using other than a knife. 

 - added: hauling information messages if you try to haul items while wading

        Hauling while wading isn't possible, but there was no message to clarify this.
        Now the game tells you that it's not possible and suggest to push items to the shore
        instead.

 - added: sauna stove

        There are no fireplaces in saunas anymore, but sauna stoves instead. Sauna stove
        appearance and usage is similar to fireplace. Having this new sauna stove tile has
        no specific usage yet but preceeds the future sauna related improvements. 

 - improved: lighting effect of fires 

        Lighted area is now roundish and its' radius depends on size of the fire. As the fire gradually
        goes down you also see decrease in lit area. This affects to both campfires and lit fireplaces. 

 - added: precise time passing featured on bunch of new tasks

       Added for general diy crafting, making and repairing clothes, timbercraft tasks (logs, 
       boards, firewood etc.), hideworking tasks (cleaning, curing, tanning), digging a pit,
       preparing the soil, grinding flour.

 - added: option to stand still until not fatigued

        This option is available in movement and rest actions menu, or can it be activated 
        by [ALT] + [-] hotkey. 
        
 - added: unpaid category & standardized hotkeys to inventory filtering 

        * There's now "unpaid" category within inventory filter menu (TAB) showing all
          your unpaid/taken items. 
        
	* Shortcut keys for item types have been standardized.
	  w - weapons, a - armours & clothing, c - containers, h - hides & skins etc.

 - added: direction is told in sound based messages

        Eg. "You hear a tree falling down in the east.", "You hear rustle of wings from
        the north." etc.

 - changed: e[X]changing weapons if a shield is wielded now costs a turn

 - changed: raw meat and raw fish now floats

        To avoid accidentally losing meat or fish when operating with a kill or catch by
        the shore.

 - modding fix: incorrect weight of modded [patchwise] cookery items

          For example:
          If you made batch of 5 cookery items which required 2.5 lbs of raw materials
          all together you got 5 cookery items each weighing 2.5 lbs - even though you 
          should have gotten 5 cookery items each weighing 0.5 lbs. (2.5 / 5 = 0.5)

 - changed: only the items that don't float can be buried in bogs

 - removed: wheat bread

        Old item which didn't fit in the word. There's no wheat.

 - changed: clothes and armours being worn can be offered in a trade

 - changed: foreign traders don't fell trees anymore as their lagtime activity

 - changed message: "[creature] escapes." -> "[creature] flees."

 - fixed: sounds of fighting NPCs at the area occasionally being played when 
          loading map or sleeping

 - fixed: being able to command NPCs of single house settlement to go away

 - fixed: NPCs climbing steep elevations too fast

 - fixed: being able to [a]pply animal leashes on world map

 - fixed: wrong "block of wood(s)" plural -> "blocks of wood"

 - fixed: a rare condition of trapped unconscious animals attacking

 - fixed: being able to [a]pply animal leashes on world map

 - fixed: leashed pet duplication when returning to village where your departed
          companion had recently returned

 - fixed: animals tied to trees occasionally roaming free

        Some iterations of this bug were fixed before, but a new bug prone instance 
        was discovered. Report back if this bug still persists.

 - fixed: wading animals moving too fast

 - fixed: auto-tracking on world map occasionally displaying "You don't notice any tracks." 

 - fixed: movement restrictions from penalties not always applied when rowing

 - fixed: unconscious NPCs blocking other NPCs from moving to same tile

        Now aggressive NPCs will walk over unconscious ones. 
        When selecting a target from location with multiple NPCs the conscious NPC 
        is always chosen if available.

 - fixed: humans can recognize trap-fences and understand to avoid traps there

 - fixed: cave crashes (specifically with .rpm package on Fedora)

 - fixed: location with traps spawning copies of earlier creatures at the area

        It was very rare occasion, but when triggered you could have same type of NPCs
        spawning at the area day after day. 

 - fixed: container price wasn't taken into account in item price calculations

 - fixed: villagers knowing your breaches without seeing you in action

        Sight check was broken which caused villagers to magically be aware of your minor breaches
        such as harvesting their crops or building a fire. Minor breaches are now properly based on
        NPC sight so if they don't see you in action they don't know you did it. You still shouldn't
        try to push your luck by building fires or felling trees near the village center, because
        the guilty one is sometimes also easily guessed.

 - fixed: light from fires shined through obstacles

        Fires use line-of-sight mechanics now, and the light from fires reaches only where it 
        actually can.
	
 - fixed: hiding mode not cancelled when hauling items

 - fixed: "source of livelihood" game course task was weight based

        Now true nutritional value of the food you are carrying is taken into account.

 - fixed: fighting leashed pets not following the player character

 - fixed: wooden tub price decreased (to one third)

 - fixed: multiple entries for "human shaped figure in distance" displayed (so that you
          can't guess if a world map wanderer is actually party of robbers)

 - fixed: being asked if you want to swim when entering zoom maps with deep water

        Character was properly located on dry land, but the question appeared nevertheless.

 - fixed: "impact doesn't penetrate your armor" displayed for unarmoured characters

        There's now "The impact doesn't hurt you." alternative.

 - fixed: repairing a piece of clothing with itself 

 - fixed: bug potential with old animals getting removed from zoomed-in maps

        There was a vulnerability which might have caused old animals to rarely disappear from 
        zoomed-in maps. It's secured now and animals should never just disappear suddenly.

 - fixed: rowing mode got cancelled when moving without a paddle or sesta in launched watercraft

        This resulted in watercraft not being properly transported with you between world and 
        zoom maps.

 - fixed: it was possible to start hiding while rowing, swimming, or hauling items

 - fixed: spots of lichen or other ground cover appearing in the water - old topography bug.

 - fixed: nettles (and other grass plants) worked as {hemp} in diy requirements

 - fixed: tied pets sometimes followed you onto world map and got stuck there

        This fix isn't verified, so report back if this issue still persists.

 - fixed: pets staying on burning fires

 - fixed: birds couldn't fly over high cliffs

 - fixed: being able to set nets on ice if there was a hole in the ice nearby

 - fixed: saving between midning and morning caused various morning related checks to be
          skipped the next morning - you couldn't milk your cow, wounds didn't heal,
          skill flags weren't reset.
 
        For migrated characters a bugged morning check skip may occur upon reload if you
        had saved between midnight and morning, but after the next save it's all synchronised
        and fixed.

 - fixed: injury score from old injuries occasionally being added to new frostbites
 
 - fixed: NPC crops growing in water (on fields next to a lake)
      
 - fixed: robbers picking up items they couldn't carry made the items disappear

 - fixed: wilderness location where angry villagers or robbers might throw you away not
          properly randomized 

        Previously only the north-west location was chosen, now there's proper randomized
        variety.
        
 - fixed: free sauna items 

        Sauna scoops and tubs of water aren't free to take anymore. 

 - fixed & balanced: skiing and walking in the snow

        * In addition to being fatiguing, walking in the snow is now also about 20% slower.

        * Skiing skill matters and skiing is now also fatiguing, but always faster and easier
          than than walking in the snow.

          Now your skiing skill determines how fatiguing it is for you to ski. The more
          skilled you are, the less of an effort it is to ski. Only highly skilled skiers get
          close to zero fatigue accumulation anymore, but skiing skill still improves quite
          fast so most characters can build up decent skiing skills during single winter. 
          In any case skiing is always faster and less fatiguing than walking in the snow. 

        * Skiing is cancelled and you are notified to remove your skis when the time of the
          year doesn't suit skiing.

 - fixed: food in NPC villages/camps never spoils - old exploit

 - fixed: setting bait to a direction you can't see wasted the bait

 - fixed: hauling not cancelled when pushing a hauled carcass

 - fixed: skinning ignored carcass beneath another one 

 - fixed: being able to build ceiling and floor on the same tile where it was already built

 - fixed: "and X more..." not calculating correctly the number of items being prepared

 - fixed: hiding from robbers was impossible during the phase when they come to talk to you

 - fixed: missed shots that hit a group member of the original target didn't cause
          a morale check

 - fixed: sleeping or unconscious creatures prevented hiding

	Entering hiding mode wasn't possible if you were in "sight" of sleeping or unconscious
        creatures.

 - fixed: shield protection glitches

        They protected too much in neutral position and too little when held on the left side.

 - fixed: cancelling tasks skipped the possible morning maintenance and physical condition
          checks

 - fixed: creatures standing on cellar were invisible

 - fixed: when milking into a container filled with water the contents weren't emptied first

 - fixed: small animals (eg. squirrels and hares) being able to wade

 - fixed: foreign traders messed up item tags in the villages and made the items 
          unpurchaseable

 - fixed: location selection dialog closes when choosing a location you can't see

 - fixed: villagers stocking stale food 

 - fixed: skin not obtained if skinning got cancelled during the last minute

        If the skinning task got cancelled due to exhaustion (or whatever) at the very last
        moment of the skinning process you didn't obtain the hide, but the animal was still
        marked skinned. 

 - fixed: spoiled food items occasionally not stacking

        This was related to markers of their original quality. The conflicting markers are now
        cleared upon spoilage. Notice that the old non-stacking spoiled food items your
        character may have will remain non-stacking.

 - fixed: stale tag persisting upon cooking 

        You might get "Roasted stale perch" etc. Now stale tag disappears properly upon
        cooking, and the results of cooking stale food items aren't delicious.

 - fixed: waking up to strange noises when falling asleep from exhaustion while rowing
          or running

 - fixed: animals might freeze for moment upon escaping if their escape destination was
          badly chosen

 - fixed: drinking from containers taking too much time

 - fixed: villagers joining the robbers when they enter the village area

 - fixed: NPC/villager reactions to robbers was broken

        Now both the wandering NPCs and villagers react properly to presence of robbers. 
        They rarely attack the robbers right away but keep them on eye. If the robbers cross
        the line by coming too close, then the people don't hesitate to attack them.

 - fixed: terrestial animals sleeping in shallow water

 - fixed: repeated deathblows with [3] fail to keep the previous aiming zone if any menu
          selections or certain actions (eg. sleeping) were made in between the deathblows

 - fixed: leashed animals not properly freed upon getting defeated and thrown away from the
          location by robbers or villagers

        Now your animals are unleashed. You may, or may not find them again.

 - fixed: wading on land if you were too fatigued/penalized to move at all and tried to 
          start wading

 - fixed: sauna scoops and wooden tubs disappearing from villages

 - fixed: carcasses tagged as partially skinned even if the skinning wasn't allowed 
          (ie. while swimming)

 - fixed: arrow-in-loading bug: NPCs could shoot you while the map was only loading


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 3.19 (stable)
Released: 16-Sep-2014

** Saved characters from version 3.17-> are compatible with this version. **

 - command and interface changes 

        Take a note of these, but remember that pressing ? in the game and looking at menus
        will still reveal you the old and new game controls.

        - [+] works as an alternate key to bring up [M]ake menu     

        - [l] works as an alternate key to look at distant location ([F3])

        - primary key command to filter inventory is now [Tab]. 
          [.] remains as an alternate key to filter inventory.
 
        - mouse wheel can be used to scroll inventory

        - in [w]ield menu pressing [-] means "wield nothing" and takes off all wielded weapons

        - a quick way to unwield weapons in [T]ake off menu 

          Pressing [1] or [2] in take off menu will unwield primary or secondary weapon.
          This is a quick way to free a desired hand.
          Remember that [w]ield and [-] takes off all wielded weapons at once.

        - [s]kills screen remembers the last selection

          If you use skills via [s]kills screen the cursor is positioned at the last 
          selection. This way [s] and [enter] can be used to repeat the last skill.

        - Pressing ESC is equivalent to No in "Yes/No" confirmation screens.

        * new menu: movement and rest actions

          Running, hiding, sleeping, waiting and getting up on your feet can be now activated
          from a single menu. You can bring up the movement and rest actions menu with [/] or
          [Del] keys.
 
          There are still hotkeys for all these movement and rest actions, even though some 
          key changes have been made. Read on.

        * extended commands menu has been removed

          Extended commands menu which was previously accessed via [#] or [e] is history.
          New hotkeys have been assigned for the following activities, and the game will help
          you to memorize them. If you try to use extended commands you'll be notified about 
          the new hotkeys.
 
          "Rise on your feet" 
          New hotkey to get up on your feet is [u] and you'll also find this option in movement 
          and rest actions menu.

          "Sleep" 
          New hotkey to sleep is [Z] and you'll also find this option in movement and rest 
          actions menu. There's configuration option in urw_ini.txt to define if you want a
          confirmation to sleep when pressing the hotkey. 

          "Cut a carcass" 
          New hotkey to butcher a carcass is [b] 

          "Wounds" 
          New hotkey to view (and also treat) wounds and injuries is [F7] 
	
        * container handling changes

          As extended menu is history, containers are now handled via [a]pply command.

          All the container actions (emptying, filling with water or milk, and pouring something 
          into) are now done via [a]pply command. After [a]pplying a container you get to select
          a desired container handling option from a menu. 
          
          Notice that there's a change in work order of pouring something into a container:
          Now you first select a container you want to stuff, and then select what you want to 
          pour in there.

          Default item filtering of [a]pply command now also lists containers and filled
          containers. And this more convenient item filtering continues when pouring something 
          into a container.

 - added: two new start-up scenarios
      
        * You encounter a band of ruffians in the wilderness.
 
        * You set out into the unforgiving wilderness with a four-legged companion.

        Storylines written by Kerri Barnard.

 - added: repeat previous attack maneuver [3] also works with deathblows

 - added: weapon breakage & degrade system

        Weapons used in the battle can get damaged and break.

        Weapons can get damaged when they hit together as a result of a block, or fumbled 
        counterstrikes. Resulting damage checks are based on variety of newly added weapon 
        properties and both attacker's and defender's weapon may get damaged. In general the 
        heaviest, best quality and fastest swinging weapon stays undamaged, but when weapons 
        of equal attributes clang together it may be harmful for both combatants. Weapon 
        material also matters in damage calculations - steel cuts wood and not vice versa.

        When weapons get damaged their [wear] bar in inventory shows up and keeps decreasing
        according to level of damage. The weapon quality also degrades after substantial amount 
        of damage. Eventually damaged weapons will break completely. Sometimes a sudden weapon 
        breakage can also take place if the delivered force of impact is massive compared to 
        material strength and properties of a blocking weapon.

        The force of impact and resulting weapon damage is calculated based on strike velocity,
        weapon weight, impact area and materials that hit together. Chosen attack aspect 
        (blunt, edge or point) also affects to strike velocity and impact area giving a whole 
        new perspective to weapon usage in order to damage your opponent's weapons or shields.

        Weapons have the following new properties:
      
        * Impact area

          This refers to size of weapon head/tip/blade that actually touches the target 
          upon impact. 

        * Strike velocity

          Certain strikes with certain weapons get a velocity boost increasing the force of
          impact they can cause. Swords, clubs with lengthy shafts (e.g. warhammers and maces)
          and axes can be all considered high velocity weapons.

        * Wear/break/fracture levels

          Amount of force needed to wear/break/fracture a weapon.
	
        These all come into play when weapon damage checks are done. The factors are so far 
        hidden but you'll soon learn what breaks what and how easily. Most of the weapon 
        breakage stuff should be quite obvious as the system tries to come close to sort of a 
        realistic weapon damage behaviour.

        Few examples: 

        Thrust (point) with a sword concentrates the force on much smaller area than a 
        swing (edge). But on the other hand, sword strike has the highest velocity when it's
        used in a slashing movement.

        There is not much difference in impact area if you thrust with a large knife or a spear. 
        But spear is heavier and can be thrusted with more velocity and this results in much
        more force being delivered with a spear thrust. 

        Maces and warhammers are excellent choices for breaking shields. They have lots of mass
        and a proper swing with them makes the head strike with high velocity. Especially the 
        warhammer concentrates lots of force and mass on small impact area.

        All in all, there's now lots of new tactics, factors and weapon usage to consider when 
        going to battle. Effective dodging saves weapons, but if your enemy effectively keeps 
        blocking your fierce sword strikes it may leave you with damaged weapon. Weapon breakage 
        system is also a big balancing addition, and kind of justifies reasonable hoarding of 
        metal weapons. Now you can't expect to keep on using your favourite sword again and 
        again without possibly wearing it out someday.

 - added: configuration option to turn weapon damage off (urw_ini.txt)
	
        Weapon damage & degrade system hasn't been fully tested, and some may find it too harsh 
        as there is not (yet) possibility to repair weapons. For these reasons there's 
        configuration option to turn weapon damage off. Set [WEAPON_DAMAGE:YES] in urw_ini.txt 
        to [WEAPON_DAMAGE:NO] to turn off weapon damage system.

 - added: worn out armours and clothes provide less protection

        Protection values of damaged clothes/armours are decreased by percentage of damage.

 - tweaked: all big rocks in fortified villages are now too steep to be climbed

          Previously you could just climb over them so they didn't really provide much of 
          fortification.

 - tweaked: each of the two game-courses (F5) can be played and completed only once per character

 - added: food will become stale a day or two before turning spoiled. It's still usable, but the
          quality is lost.

 - added: an option to choose start location within your home culture

	Random world generation features a new option to randomize your start location within
        your home culture.

 - added: robbers

        There are now robber NPCs wandering around the wilderness. Robbers can be of any
        culture and usually move in bands of 3-6 people. If encountered, they may try to steal  
        your equipment. Robbers rarely attack right away but often ask if you want to hand over
        your stuff willingly. If you don't co-operate they'll attack and rob your equipment
        after you've been beaten unconscious (or dead). 

 - updated terrain type images: spruce mire (summer), pine heath (summer)

 - chat-screen slightly stylized

 - added: aggressive/escaping animals and NPCs can wade through shallow water

 - fixed & balanced: milking

        * Animals will stay put while being milked

        * Name of the animal (if it has one) now appears in the following milking messages:
          "Thank you for the milk, <animal_name>."
          "It seems <animal_name> can't yield any more milk today."

        * Sheeps and cows don't produce any milk during wintertime. This dry period lasts 
          about 5 months of the year. 

        * A daily milk yield of a cow varies between 2-5 lbs. You don't always get a full tub
          of it anymore.
        
 - fixed & balanced: time passing

        Many time consuming actions are minute based in unrealistic fashion: for each 
        spent minute NPCs get only one turn. Time passing is now more precise here and there
        and can handle seconds too. Some actions may appear less time consuming than they used
        to be, but NPCs have more turns during those more precisely measured actions.
        For example: previously undressing a heavy shirt could take 3 minutes, and NPCs had
        three turns during that time. Now undressing a heavy shirt can take only 30 seconds,
        but nevertheless NPCs get to make those 3 turns during that time. 
        
        Precise time passing currently applies to:

        most skills, standing by [-], climbing, loading crossbows, dressing and undressing, 
        eating, wound treatment, building fires, cooking, setting & re-triggering traps,
        fishing, milking animals

 - added: message log - view previous game messages, and enter your own notes

        Messages (that are displayed at the bottom right of the game screen) are now archived.
        You can view message log by [v] key command. 
        (For manual browsing it's msglog.txt file in your character folder, human-readable format.)

        In message log screen you can also write your own notes to the log. These custom notes 
        can be used as memory aid, or to add personal touch to your message chronicle.

        Date and location information are already encoded into message log and in the future
        this information will be used to allow more detailed viewing/sorting.

        Message log is useful for the player alone, but also provides a way to share your 
        character's life in better detail. Sharing a screenshot about an epic situation will be 
        even better with an epic message log.

 - added: automatic stand up when trying to run when prone

        No need to first get up and then start running. If your condition prevents you from 
        getting up you'll be notified about it.

 - added: more precise weight display for less than 1 lb items

          Instead of <1 lbs you'll now see the weight with one decimal precision, eg. 0.3 lbs.

 - added: looking at nearby location will show track info too

        Using [:] (examine current location) and [x] (look to a given direction) commands
        will display track information too. There's no actual need to use your tracking skill
        separately on zoomed-in map anymore as this is equivalent to skill usage and 
        can reveal new tracks on the site too. 

 - added: look to a given direction command [x] also accepts pressing 5 on numpad or mouse 
          clicking the character to examine current location
        
 - added: skill dependant shooting rate for regular bows

        How fast your character reloads and shoots an arrow is now dependant on your 
        BOW-skill. The effects of this are clearly shown if your BOW mastery level is 
        lower than 25% or higher than 70%. Otherwise all the characters shoot pretty much
        with the same speed. The first shot is still fastest to perform if you have an
        an arrow already wielded ie. you are carrying the bow and arrow readied for a quick 
        shot.

 - added: shield usage to protect from missile attacks

        Shields can be used to protect from missile attacks. When a shield is held in 
        protective position missile attacks to covered body parts are automatically blocked
        as they hit the shield instead of you. NPCs can also use shields in similar fashion.
        There are no changes to shield usage against melee attacks. 

        * shields can be held in many ways to cover different body parts and to protect from 
          varying lines of attack

          Upon wielding a shield you get to select how to hold it. It's possible to change
          the chosen shield mode anytime by pressing attack commands keys [1] and [2]  
          depending on whether you're holding the shield as a primary (1) or secondary (2) 
          weapon. It depends on the shield size how large area it can protect. 
           
          Shield modes to automatically protect from missile attacks are:

          CENTER - Neutral position where the shield is held in front of you close to your 
                   center. In this position roundshields protect from neck to knees. 

          HIGH   - The shield is held up in front of you. In this position roundshields
                   protect the head and upper body. It's a good way to cover the vital upper
                   body, but your vision is restricted as you have to peek from behind the
                   shield.

          SIDE   - The shield is held raised by your side. In this position roundshields
                   protect your side from shoulder to knees. If the shield is your primary 
                   weapon it's held on your right side, otherwise on the left side.

          All of these shield modes make you walk and run slower as the chosen protective
          grip and stance is carefully maintained during movements. For this reason it's 
          advisable to use protective shield mode only when necessary. 
          
          NONE   - Shield is carried in relaxed fashion and not held in protective way.
                   As the shield moves freely along with your movements there's no 
                   automatic cover provided except for the hand and arm holding the 
                   shield.
        
        * Relative direction of missile attack and character's facing direction affect to 
          whether the shield protects you or not. For example: if you hold the shield on 
          your right side and are shot from the left it doesn't protect you.

        * Roundshields are now more commonly found even among local tribes. 

        * Shield prices have been reasoned down to 1/3 from what they used to be. 

 - updated: SHIELD game encyclopedia entry (F1)

        It's the same information as above. 

 - added: eye injuries may cause you to lose sight

        Significant eye injuries will cut away according sector from your field of vision.
        Sight of injured eyes will return when the wound has healed to a level where
        it's possible to keep the eye open again.
 
 - added: blunt and broadhead arrows

        Many local cultures use both of these new arrow types. Blunt arrows can be also 
        crafted by yourself.

        * Blunt arrows 

          Used to hunt small game without damaging the hide. Blunt arrow impact can be enough
          to kill fragile animals immediately, but their ability to knock animals unconscious 
          is just as effective in order to obtain undamaged hides. Also, they never stuck.

        * Broadhead arrows

          Arrows with the widest cutting head of all arrow types. Broadheads are designed to 
          cause large cuts and inflict as much bleeding as possible. These arrows are 
          effectively used to hunt large game. 

        * there are game encyclopedia entries (F1) about BLUNT ARROWs and BROADHEAD ARROWs

 - added: woodsmen and adventurers may occasionally carry furs 

        These furs are naturally culturally dependent and are often those of smaller game.

 - added: bears can now break down fences (if they want to)

 - added: NPC "prey-predator" relationships

        * NPCs now actively react to presence of other human beings, specifically those 
          of another culture

          For now this is most notable when Njerpez meet other cultures, but later on the 
          system will be expanded to create cultural conflicts. These NPC reactions are 
          effective regardless of your character's presence so you may occasionally find
          traces of violent confrontations in the wild. Or you may now get to witness a lone 
          woodsman espacing an aggressive Njerpez warrior, villagers attacking the Njerpez 
          first, or your companion being attacked before you have even spotted the red shirts.

        * NPCs can have wider scope of attitudes towards other people

          In a sense variety of NPC reactions gets closer to behaviour repertoire we already
          have in use with wild animals. In addition to being blunt aggressive or peaceful 
          people may now try to avoid you, stay hidden, try to chase you away or prefer to 
          escape upon being spotted. And it is the Njerpez who have this new behaviour and 
          attitude system currently in use.

        * Njerpez aren't always hostile, but not friendly either

          Njerpez behaviour of attacking with 100% certainty is history. Especially the lone 
          warriors may very well choose to escape or stay hidden instead of attacking. Njerpez
          still don't want to interact with other cultures, but encountering them doesn't 
          always lead to spilling of blood anymore. It's now possible that Njerpez circles 
          around your camp while you are a sleep, and instead of waking up with an arrow
          in the eye you now just noticed his footprints. For Njerpez who are encountered in 
          their war camps or villages attacking the intruders still remains a top priority. 

 - new configuration options (urw_ini.txt)

        * swim automatically

          AUTO_SWIM option in urw_ini.txt defines if swimming is automatically started when 
          necessary. Possible values are YES, NO or ASK. It's set to ASK by default.

        * automatically climb steep terrain

          AUTO_CLIMB_ELEVATION option in urw_ini.txt defines if climbing is automatically
          started when moving at steep terrain which requires climbing skills.
          Possible values are YES, NO or ASK. It's set to ASK by default.

        * AUTO_CLIMB option has been renamed to AUTO_CLIMB_FENCE. It's set to ASK by default.

        * customise inventory item type order

          You can change item listing order by editing INVENTORY_ORDER value in urw_ini.txt.
          Default inventory order goes as follows:
          [INVENTORY_ORDER:WEAPON,ARMOUR,CONTAINER,SKIN,TOOL,FOOD,FIREWOOD,VEHICLE,VALUABLE,PLANT,CARCASS]

        * open doors automatically
 
          AUTO_OPEN_DOOR value in urw_ini.txt defines whether the doors will be opened automatically
          or not when you walk at them. It's set to YES by default.

        * "traditional" movement mode

          Instead UrW's default facing direction based movement mode you can choose to use 
          traditional roguelike movement by changing TRADITIONAL_MOVEMENT value in urw_ini.txt
          to YES
  
          In traditional movement mode character moves to a direction given by numpad or
          cursor keys as follows:
          up/8 - north, 9 - north-east, right/6 - east, 3 - south-east, 
          down/2 - south, 1 - southwest, 4/left - west, 7 -  north-west

        * pause after zooming in is optional

          PAUSE_AFTER_ZOOM value in urw_ini.txt defines if you want a pause and having to press 
          space after zooming into a terrain. 
          Possible value are YES and NO. It's set to NO by default.

        * confirmation to sleep
          
          SLEEP_CONFIRMATION value in urw_ini.txt defines if you want to be asked yes/no
          confirmation when you press a hotkey to sleep. It's set to NO by default, and 
          this confirmation is never asked if you sleep via movement and rest actions menu.

 - added: only the first 5 items are displayed automatically when stepping on a stack of items 

        And after those first 5 items you'll be notified how many items were left unlisted. 
        This removes excess [SPACE] rumble. Full item list is always displayed only when 
        specifically looking at the location.

 - added: strafing movement - CTRL + numpad keys

        You can now move to any direction without changing character's facing direction by 
        holding down CTRL and pressing movement keys.
     
        CTRL + numpad 8/up    = "strafe" to north 
        CTRL + numpad 9/PgUp  = "strafe" to north-east
        CTRL + numpad 6/right = "strafe" to east
        etc.
	
 - added: carcasses can be moved and picked up

        Now you can move, push or pick up carcasses just like any items. Common item handling
        commands (eg. throwing) also work for carcasses while they are in your inventory.

        Notice that when picking up items carcasses are excluded from "select all items" 
        option [+] if there are no selections done yet. This is because we rarely want to 
        pick up carcasses of NPCs even though we often want to quickly select and pick up
        all their items. 

 - added: rotting mechanism for carcasses 

        Carcasses now rot, decay and eventually disappear. This is relatively slow process
        and scavengers will utilize rotting carcasses too, but humans may obtain usable
        meat and hide only from fresh (< 2 days old) carcasses. In the wintertime carcasses 
        preserve for a longer time.

 - added: carcasses can be burnt
        
        You can now burn carcasses, and thus have a kind of "burial" for your dead pets and 
        companions. 

 - added: pausable cutting and skinning & improved carcass selection

        * Cutting and skinning carcasses are now pausable tasks

          It's still encouraged to skin and cut animals in swift manner, but now it's 
          possible take a break at will without losing the progress.

          If cutting is paused you'll still obtain meat cuts according to spent time. This way
          you can cut only small portion of big carcass if it's time critical to get some meat.
          Only when carcass is cut completely you'll also obtain the fat from it.

        * Carcass selection automation is a bit wiser and also allows player to choose
          preferred carcass 
 
          If there's only one carcass nearby, you are standing on a carcass, or there's a 
          carcass in front of you it will be automatically selected - in this order respectively. 
          Otherwise you'll be asked for a direction of carcass you prefer to cut/skin.

 - added: people remove their dead from the village

        They do not arrange proper burials yet, but dead community members will be 
        removed from the village area.

 - balanced: agriculture

        * weight of pod type plant yield decreased

          Weight of single fistful of peas and beans has been decreased down to one tenth of
          what it used to be. Especially broad beans were excessively productive and now
          their yield weight is a lot better balanced.

        * animals can feed on sprouts 

          Animals can eat plants before they are ready to be harvested and can therefore
          cause real damage to growing crops. Animals such as hares, badgers, elks and 
          forest reindeers may eat variety of sprouts even if the ripe yield wouldn't fit 
          their preferred diet.

        * harvesting grain crops is fatiguing and used tool matters

          Harvesting grain crops is now slightly fatiguing and sickle is preferred tool 
          for the job. It's still possible to use any cutting weapon to harvest grain crops,
          but you lose some yield. Harvesting grain crops without a sickle is also 
          slower and bit more fatiguing. 

 - balanced: net fishing

        * Terminology change: "pulling the net up" -> "retrieving the net"
          It's the same action, but "retrieve" term is now used in menus and messages.
            
        * You can't set nor retrieve nets while swimming. 

        * Setting and retrieving a net is time consuming (10-35 minutes). The actual time 
          depends on your fishing skill, and when retrieving a net the amount of catch 
          also matters. 

        * Nets will wear out in use. 

          Every time a net is set and retrieved it wears out a bit, and the bigger the catch
          the more it can damage the net. How fast a net wears out depends greatly on your 
          fishing skills. A talented fisherman can handle the net so that it doesn't get 
          tangled upon setting or retrieving, nor unnecessarily damaged upon releasing the 
          fish. A novice fisherman is prone to handle the net in more clumsy fashion which
          results in wearing it out faster. 

 - added: skill analysis messages displayed when using fishing maneuvers which are prone 
          to physical penalties (club fishing, and setting nets)

 - balanced: shooting with crossbows

        In general crossbows are now a bit easier to shoot with. Their greatest advantage
        still is that they can be carried loaded, but these new tweaks bring in a few more:

        * Only half of your physical penalties degrade the performance when shooting a 
          crossbow. This is because it's far less of a physical exercise to pull the 
          trigger than to draw a regular bow.

        * 10% skill bonus is added to each attempt to shoot with a crossbow. They just are 
          easier to shoot even for the unskilled.

        * Completely blown shots are excluded with crossbows. With regular bows a shot is
          most often failed during releasing the string. With crossbows releasing the string
          by pulling the trigger is always quite steady. 
      
        * Possible cone of spread is always smaller with crossbows. With failed shots your
          aiming can never get as much off as with regular bows.

        * It's very fast to release an arrow from a loaded crossbow

          It's rarely possible to shoot with a regular bow within melee range because your
          opponent usually gets to make a move in time you draw the bowstring. But loaded
          crossbows can be shot fast enough to be used even within melee range.
 
        * Crossbow loading times reasoned

          It takes half a minute to load a regular crossbow and about a minute to load
          a heavy crossbow. During this time NPCs and other creatures can make up to 3-6 
          moves.

 - balanced: rowing is now moderately fatiguing

 - balanced: running backwards speed

        Running backwards is now only about half as fast as forwards.

 - balanced: foreign traders

 	* Weapon skills increased. You can expect pretty much every foreign trader to be 
          talented with pretty much every weapon he carries. 

        * They move more tightly as a group and appear in groups of 5-8 members

 - balanced: getting automatically on your feet after sleep 

        Unless it's combat/encounter situation you always automatically get on your feet 
        after sleep if you are feeling at least lively. 

 - fixed: spend loops sometimes not cancelled when you were attacked 

        This resulted in having to repeatedly choose a defense maneuver.
        Now it gets cancelled properly and there are two messages depending on the situation:
        1) You're engaged with a hostile creature...
        This is shown when there's an aggressive NPC/animal beside you.
               
        2) You have been attacked...
        This is shown when you are actually getting hit.

 - fixed: unable to dry meat on walls/corners/shelter diagonal to character

 - fixed: being able to shoot an arrow from inventory with an injured hand

 - fixed: confusing free (worn) load <> encumbrance display 

          Free load (of worn armous) was decreased from load, so total load
          wasn't displayed correctly. 

 - fixed: broken burden calculations when packing animals

 - fixed: it wasn't possible to go back to main chat screen when buying animals

 - fixed: if house was built real close to the southern edge of zoomed in map the icon 
          placement/display on the world map might fail

 - fixed: some raw material selection glitches

        When selecting raw materials from inventory sometimes a portion of unselected (and 
        unapplicable) items were used. It's suspected, but not yet confirmed, that this 
        also resulted in mistakenly named modded items and random items appearing in 
        inventory. 

 - fixed: being able to throw leashes in use

 - fixed: fishing improvement was possible if setting a net got cancelled by the player, or due 
          to physical condition requirements

 - fixed: swimming fatigue increased slower in winter

 - fixed: NPCs getting blocked by small traps

        People can now walk over small traps. Previously you could block their route even
        with loop snares.

 - fixed: items disappearing from character's inventory if new stuff is obtained when 
          inventory is full

        This could happen when you crafted an item but were out of inventory slots (max. 90).
        Now excess obtained items are put on the ground and a warning message is displayed.

 - fixed: surrounding cultural area not cleared upon wiping out villages

        Now uninhabitated cultural areas within 3x3 culture block are properly cleared if  
        village is wiped out. 

 - fixed: "in use" status mistakenly persisting for some triggered traps

        Sometimes you could't reset triggered traps without re-releasing them first by kicking.
        This is fixed now. 

 - fixed: "falling upwards" when climbing down

        If you fell when climbing down you returned back up where you started. This is fixed
        and now you fall all the way down getting where you wanted - not always without 
        injuries though.

 - fixed: deconstructing NPC buildings returns wrong or none items

 - fixed: deconstructing certain tiles built with mods (eg. well, road etc.) returns wrong or none items 

 - fixed: wrong cause of death displayed upon dying to mushroom poisoning

 - fixed: building (a house) game course task getting completed upon building anything at all

 - fixed: endless loop if last empty line in mods was missing

        Reading of diy/biy/cookery files didn't properly stop to end of file, and if there 
        was no empty line after the last item specifications it resulted in endless loop.

 - fixed: effort levels for variety of timbercraft options weren't active

        Carving logs, chopping trunk into blocks etc. were all "easy" efforts. 

 - fixed: climbing over map borders prevented loading of new maps

        This happened for example when climbing a long distance on fences and resulted in
        encountering empty map blocks.

 - fixed: necklace item sometimes appeared as fistful of blueberries

 - fixed: sickle could be used to fell down big trees

 - fixed: trading quirks when trying to re-purchase items that you had once returned 

        If you returned items to villagers because of not being able to pay for them these
        items might occasionally became un-purchaseable; you were asked to pay, but nothing
        was shown in the debt list thus making trading of these items impossible.

        MIGRATION NOTICE:
        The bug is fixed now, but items that got corrupted this way in earlier version still 
        remain un-purchaseable in villages you had visited.

 - fixed: culture reset bug

        Cultural areas might reset upon crash/power loss resulting in whole map appearing
        as kaumolais area. Now cultural area data is occasionally backuped and restored if 
        something goes wrong. The game will also notify you if culture reset bug happens
        so that you can give more detailed bug report about what just happened.

 - fixed: arrow stacking issues 

 - fixed: sleepwalking issues & zoomed in map glitches when sleeping near map boundaries

 - fixed: incorrect animal packing times

 - fixed: crash potential with lengthy material usage messages

        It might happen if you used lots of different raw material stacks/items on 
        the ground.

 - fixed: fires didn't burn out properly if you left the area
          
        Even after several days spent away from the area you might still find your campfire 
        burning. That's fixed now.

 - fixed: rowing/wading/swimming movement noise was too silent

        As a result it was too easy to approach for example aquatic birds.

 - fixed: beavers fatiguing themselves by swimming

        Now aquatic animals can swim extremely long distances without getting fatigued,
        and it's practically impossible to catch them by rowing.

 - fixed: sleeping aquatic birds in the water had no sprite displayed

 - fixed: craftsmen didn't ever sleep

 - fixed: world location descriptions not always correctly based on nearest culture

 - fixed: harvested flowering plants not yielding flowers when treshed

        This bug happened if you picked up harvested plants before threshing them. 
       
 - fixed: being able to leash pets with multiple ropes -> pet duplication

        You could do this by mistake and it resulted in pet duplication.
        For example: you had a pet tied to a tree and then applied a rope from your 
        inventory to leash it (again). The game allowed this, and the pet got 
        double-leashed and then duplicated.
          
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.18 (stable)
Released: 27-Feb-2014

** Saved characters from version 3.17-> are compatible with this version. **

(If you are new to version 3.18 be sure to scroll down for a complete newslist for 
 version 3.18 since the first beta version.)

 - balanced: character made clothes are now worth of only 20% of regular cloth value

          And that's because there's no actual skill required and making clothes is way 
          too fast. This removes the exploit of too easy trading with character made 
          clothes.

 - added: making a log, boards or blocks of wood also cuts branches from the trunk

          And couple of dozen branches will appear lying on the ground. These are 
          always just plain branches as fallen tree type isn't (yet) distinguished.

 - added: option to cancel crafting right after completing material selections

          Prompt to start crafting now appears as:
          "[SPACE] to continue -- [ESC] cancel"

 - added: [a]pply command can be used to wield sesta, paddle or ski stick

 - added: possibility to skin small animals when prone 

 - added: possibility to cut animals for meat when prone

 - added: possibility to fell slender tree when prone

 - added: villagers are unwilling to join you if the companions you hire go missing

 - added: naturally fallen slender trees

        In addition to big trunks laying around on zoomed-in maps, you can now
        occasionally find slender tree trunks too.

 - added: bunch of fresh audio

        * new music for armour coverage screen 
        * sound effects for skiing, walking in the now, wading and 
          walking on soggy soil (mires)

 - added: lots and lots of new graphics

        Majority of backgrounds, terrain type images and encyclopedia images are 
        fresh and new. Work from several different contributors and photographers is 
        being used. For copyrights, credits and licenses see:
        truegfx/credits-and-copyrights.txt

        New outlook is best to see in action, but here are some highlights:

        * all the old grainy backgrounds are replaced with new high-quality ones

        * new terrain images have a proper winter counterparts

        * some fresh images in start-up scenarios

        * new character portraits

        * bunch of new pictures in encyclopedia (F1)

          wolf, bear, ermine, glutton, reindeer, squirrel
          punt, deadfall trap, fence...

        Naming of images has been re-organized so background/terrain graphic mods are
        not compatible with this version. 

 - fixed: being able to walk on the watery edge just outside of the ice

 - fixed: companions rushing away if you told them to cut trees while zoomed in and 
          then zoomed out on wilderness map

 - fixed: pet disappearances

          Departing companions caused pets (or NPCs) go missing.

 - fixed: any tool could be used as sesta

 - fixed: trading crashes which happened if you were demanded for payment while
          carrying lots of unpaid items

 - fixed: birch-bark products wouldn't burn

 - fixed: departed companions failed to avoid traps on their way back home

 - fixed: trying to start swimming from a steep cliff didn't locate the character
          into water

 - fixed: trying to move from a cliff into shallow water set character into wading 
          mode but didn't locate him/her into water

 - fixed: climbing on a steep cliff while wading made character remain in wading mode 
          on a dry land 

 - fixed: foreign traders with nothing to trade

 - fixed: (bleeding) tags weren't shown in animal/NPC wound descriptions

 - fixed: dogs wouldn't eat stolen food even if there were no villagers around

        Dogs still won't touch unpaid food in populated villages, but will happily
        eat it as soon as there are no villagers around. 

 - fixed: starving dogs wouldn't eat any other food if there were carcasses around

 - fixed: restocking of tools, armours and clothes was absent or extremely slow

 - fixed: Njerpez items/loot being marked as unpaid/taken

 - fixed: your own arrows becoming NPC property upon hitting them

 - fixed: game course tasks where you need to kill an animal got mistakenly completed 
          if animals at the area happened to kill each others

 - fixed: game course tasks where you need to cook something got mistakenly completed 
          if NPCs cooked something 

 - fixed: companions interrupting tasks by talking

        If they have something to say now, they will wait until you're finished and
        only then speak their mind.

 - fixed: villages with no items 

        Initial village stocking failed if you approached them on zoomed-in maps.

 - fixed: advanced game course task "Kaumo furs" getting completed by entering Kaumolais
          village

 - fixed: NPCs not trading unpaid goods they picked

        If you dropped some unpaid goods and NPCs then picked them up, they wouldn't
        trade them again in one-to-one trading. 

 - fixed: NPCs being too eager to pick up unpaid items from failed trades 

        Now NPCs don't pick up items if you drop them back to the building from where 
        you originally took them. Items that are dropped outdoors will still get 
        picked up by NPCs. 

 - fixed: villages where you didn't have to pay for anything

Released: 3-Jan-2014

** Saved characters from version 3.17-> are compatible with this version. **


 BETA NOTICE:

        This is a beta release - there are likely to be bugs. Many of the 
        listed improvements will be tweaked and polished further in patches
        to follow.
        Complete newslist for version 3.18 can be found after these beta 4
        fixes and additions.

 - fixed: being able to utilize unpaid raw materials and then drop them
          without getting asked for payment

        If you utilize unpaid raw materials now you will have to pay for
        them as a whole. 

 - fixed: problems to pay for unpaid items if you had wielded or weared them 

        'Unpaid' tag still remained after completing the trade and debt list
        wasn't handled correctly.

 - fixed: if you were demanded for payment while crafting something debt list
          and unpaid tags weren't handled correctly

        This could leave you with with unpaid items that you never had to
        pay etc.

 - fixed: being called "disreputable traveller" without a reason

        NPCs might occasionally call you "disreputable" without a reason. 

 - fixed: companions lighting fires under you

        If you happened to stand on a location where NPC was building a fire 
        you could get burnt a bit. 

 - fixed: character's thirst got completely extinguished when you drank from 
          a nearly empty container when very thirsty 

 - fixed: sages did favours (healing & teaching) also for characters with bad
          reputation

        Now they won't heal you nor teach you new rituals if your overall
        reputation is low.

 - fixed: peaceful NPCs never climbing over fences

        Most of the time they still shouldn't do it, but if NPC ended up in
        a pen with no doors they stayed there forever. Now peaceful NPCs do
        climb over fences if they end up banging their head against it for 
        long enough.

 - fixed: companions got stuck in the water if they departed while swimming

 - fixed: empty containers sometimes worked as a water source in wound treatment

 - fixed: sage (and other NPC) herds

	In some forester or vagabonds villages you could find penned NPCs
        instead of penned animals.
         
 - fixed: village reputation being transferred from a previous save to the next

        You could find already hostile village with your next character if your 
        previous character had angered some village.

 - fixed: being thrown out of a village while unconscious caused village to
          go empty

 - fixed: ghost village syndrome

        In rare occasions all NPCs and animals could disappear from a village.
        This often resulted in bumping into "ghost NPCs" with no description.

 - fixed: being able to haul items while swimming

 - fixed: if NPCs refused to accept delivered items these items were nevertheless
          added to their inventory

 - fixed: hauling mode didn't stop even if you picked or pushed all the items 
          being moved
 
 - added: crawling is now fatiguing

 - added: two most influential penalties displayed in physical condition
          messages:

          Previously you were notified only about the highest penalty modifier.
          Not it goes like for example:
          "You can't run any longer due to being wounded AND being fatigued."

 - balanced: new visitors in villages are kept on eye more closely

       You may find some NPCs following you when you wander around the village.
       This makes stealing more difficult.

 - fixed & balanced: bleeding wounds 

       Fixed:

       - It was possible to faint from bloodloss during trying to stop the
         wound from bleeding. Now character always stays conscious until the
         treatment is finished.
          
       - Very well-healed wounds, with only a little injury score left, could 
         start to bleed again after failed treatment. This doesn't happen 
         anymore.

       Balanced:

       - Poor success in an attempt to stop a wound from bleeding now foremostly
         affects to treatment time. It's less likely that you need multiple
         attempts to stop the bleeding from now on.

       Changed:

       - Describing bleeding wounds.
         "BL" abbreviation is now used to mark bleeding wounds in injury 
         screen. This replaces previously used "bleeding" tag in wound 
         descriptions.

 - added: you can close and open doors behind your back, and you don't have
          to specify a direction if there's only one door around.

Complete newslist for version 3.18 starts here:

Version: 3.18 - beta 3
Released: Dec-18-2013

** Saved characters from version 3.17-> are compatible with this version. **

 BETA NOTICE:

        This is a beta release - there are likely to be bugs. Many of the 
        listed improvements will be tweaked and polished further in patches
        to follow.

 - overhauled: trading in villages and item ownership

        There are no more shop-like storehouses from where you can purchase
        goods only with craftsmen. That is history. Period.

        Goods in each village are now owned by the whole community and
        you can start trading for them with any adult village member. It
        doesn't matter in which building the goods are stocked, they are
        all available for trading. 

        Previous mechanism where trading would start right after picking
        up something from a storehouse is also history. Now you can 
        freely pick up items from buildings and in around village and start 
        trading for the collected items when you are ready. Trading for the
        collected items is started by talking to any adult village member.

	In short, to obtain village goods by trading do as follows:

        1) pick up the goods you want to purchase
        2) talk to any adult in the village
        3) trading will start

        It's that simple, but there's more to learn. Here are the most
        important changes in detail:

        * Those chubby craftsmen who used rule storehouses do still exist
          but they are just regular villagers now. 

        * There are no more shop-like storehouses with signs beside the door.
          People naturally still stock their goods in buildings so you
          should bravely enter them to see what's inside.
          
          MIGRATION NOTICE: Villages you have visited in the previous version
          continue to have storehouses with signs beside the door. But this 
          doesn't mean that they wouldn't stock tradable goods in other
          buildings as well.

        * Collecting items you want to trade for can be done by picking 
          them up, starting to move them, or packing them on your pack 
          animal. 

        * You can collect several items from several different buildings 
          and start trading only when you've got everything you want.
          Compared to previous "pick-and-trade" system it's far easier to 
          wander around the village, grab what you want, and finally 
          trade a long list of items at once.

        * Villagers can also start self-imposed bargaining if you have
          held the unpaid items in your possesion for too long - or if
          you try to  sneak away with unpaid items. You may also hear 
          villagers shouting you to come talk and trade. It's wise not
          to hesisate when you've been asked to pay. 

        * It's easy to change your mind if you don't want to trade for
          something you happened to pick up. Dropping unpaid items back to 
          their place, or close by, removes them from your debt list. 
          Picking, touching, feeling and examining items is not a decision
          to buy them. However, you will naturally need to pay for unpaid 
          items you may have destroyed, hidden or lost.
          
        * When paying your debt you can select multiple item stacks in your
          inventory at once. Your trading partner then accepts or rejects
          offered items, giving verbal feedback where necessary.

        * Offering unpaid items back to the villagers will simply make your 
          trading partner reclaim them. This can be used as a way to ease 
          your debt, or change your mind, if you notice having difficulties
          to pay what they want. However, it's always best to collect and 
          trade for items you can actually afford.

        * More detailed feedback about payed vs. asked ratio.

          After every offer NPCs will tell you how happy they are about
          the bargain so far. There are ten different lines they can say
          and these will give you a better picture about how much more you 
          should give them to have a deal. 
       
	* Inability to pay your debt

          When villagers start bartering demanding you to pay for unpaid 
          goods there's also "I can't pay" chat option available. This option
          can be used if you've picked an excess amount of debt and find it
          impossible pay what they want. If the option is chosen villagers 
          will reclaim their goods from your possession. Inability to pay on 
          demand always lowers your trading reputation, so it's best to use 
          this option only when necessary. If your trading reputation gets
          suspiciously low villagers may even banish you from their village.
        
        * Unpaid item tagging

          Unpaid items will appear tagged as [unpaid] or [taken] in your
          inventory. These tags will help you to check and manage goods to 
          purchase before bartering.
          
          If you manage to steal something, these tags will wear off in a  
          week or two so that you won't be reminded of item's previous 
          ownership forever.

	* Dealing with thieves

          Leaving a village with unpaid goods despite of villager requests 
          to start bartering, will label you as a thief. At this point it is
          not possible to start bartering anymore. Before villagers label you
          as a thief they have actively tried to come barter with you, so
          it's practically impossible to steal something by accident.
          
          If villagers consider you a thief they'll first tell you to drop
          the stolen goods, and will then attack to claim their goods by 
          force. If you are unwilling to drop the stolen goods they'll try to 
          beat you unconscious and then take what is theirs. The good news is
          that now they'll spare your life, but don't hesitate to hurt you 
          badly.

          Dropping stolen goods will cancel the pursuit, but your reputation
          is already smudged.

          After you have been defeated, or willingly dropped the stolen 
          goods, villagers will decide how to deal with you from now on.
          Their decision depends on the value of goods you tried to steal 
          and your previous breaches. If their tolerance is exceeded you will
          be banished. Even if you were allowed to stay your reputation is 
          nevertheless smudged. Even a single grand theft attempt is enough
          reason to get banished. And the word gets around.

 - improved: one-to-one trading
	
        Trading with individual NPCs to obtain items from their personal 
        inventory has undergone few improvements:

        * You can freely select items you desire from NPCs inventory using 
          the common inventory menu. Selecting multiple item stacks, or for 
          example only 4 of 12 available arrows is possible. Naturally only 
          the items he/she is willing to trade are available for selection.

        * When trading starts you can offer multiple items at once from your 
          inventory.

        One-to-one trading is started the same way as previously; talk to 
        them and choose trade option. Notice that one-to-one trading with
        villagers is not possible if you are carrying some unpaid community 
        owned goods. In that case they will ask you to pay for the goods you
        taken first. 
	 
 - improved: village inventory and restocking

        Previously we used to find goods lying around only in villages that
        used to have separate 'shop like' storehouses. Now some basic toos,
        weapons, utensils and foodstuff can be found in almost any
        settlement. Village property is naturally culturally dependent and
        quantity of stocked necessities depends on village population.
        Wealthy cultures still remain as a best source to find extra items,
        but the cool thing is that you can now occasionally find interesting
        goods among more isolated cultures as well. 

        Restocking has been balanced and improved. It's now more accurately
        based on village population and culture. 
       
        Visiting villages has now more surprise potential than previously.
        Instead of always travelling to west to fulfill one's craving for
        certain items it's now possible to find necessary goods from
        seemingly isolated settlements as well.

        With new kind of stocked goods around you can learn about diet,
        source of livelihood, common game animals and used tools of each 
        culture just by wandering around their village. Villages now look
        and appear much more lively and inhabitated.

        * Better food supplies

          Villages now have better food supplies than previously. Type of
          stocked food is culturally dependent and the amount is based on 
          village population and lifestyle. You may bump into large piles of 
          smoked fish in islander villages or witness a steady supply of 
          dried reindeer meat in the north etc.
        
        * Furs - a completely new type of village property

          Almost all the cultures stock some sort of furs, but there's 
          significant cultural variation in type and quantity. Northern and
          eastern cultures tend to have most abundant fur supply.

 - added: reputation with village

        Character's actions affect to his/her reputation with village.
        Word gets around quickly so all the inhabitants pretty much always 
        share the general opinion about you, provided that you have earned 
        your reputation within the social group in question.

        There are several reputation categories which all are tracked 
        individually. And within each reputation category there are several 
        grades of good and bad. NPCs will treat you according to reputation 
        category that fits the situation. For mixed reactions, or when
        your overall reputation matters, NPCs can draw a conclusion based on
        comparing and computing multiple reputation categories.

        Earned reputations will be revealed to you in NPC comments during
        talking, or when they find enough reason to shout a comment.

        Reputation categories are:
        
        * Trading reputation

          Increases by trading frequently, effectively and reliably. It also 
          matters how generous your offers are and how valuable deals you 
          make. Reliability in trading means that you don't change 
          your mind too often, and are always able to pay your debt.
         
          Decreases with inability to pay, hesitation, changing your mind
          too often or avoiding to pay in time. It's especially bad for your
          trading reputation if you "forget" to pay, and need to be notified
          about it frequently.

          Pros:
          NPCs may occasionally cut prices and don't hurry the payment.
          You can wander around the village with unpaid goods more freely.

          Cons: 
          NPCs may demand excessive prices and hurry you to pay. 
          You can wander around the village with unpaid goods less freely.

        * Violent reputation

          Earned by attacking peaceful villages. Degree and repetitiveness of
          committed attacks matters. 

        * Offender reputation

          Earned by doing mischievous or forbidden activities in a village. 
          These would include setting traps, building fires etc. 
          Be aware that [p]ushing village goods around is now also a minor 
          offense. 

        * Theft reputation

          Obviously earned by stealing, or trying to steal. 
          People rarely want to trade at all with notorious thieves.
        
        * Helpfulness reputation

          Increased by helping and doing favours for villagers. Currently
          the only way to help villagers is to give them goods by using
          deliver-chat option. The more valuable goods you deliver the
          the higher you'll be ranked as a helpfull soul.

          BETA NOTICE:
          In the future there will be more ways to help villagers, but
	  even now it can be useful to use your excess goods for gaining
          positive reputation among villagers.

        * Dodginess

          A general factor which is increased by acting in a way that annoys
          villagers, or makes them suspicious. Dodgy characters will be kept
          on eye more closely. Thieves, violent ones and even really 
          suspicious traders may earn a reputation of being dodgy.

        * Familiarity
      
          Familiarity reputation classifies how well-known you are within 
          a certain community. Familiarity is gained by overall interaction,
          visits and time spent with a certain community. You enter their
          village as a stranger and people slowly start to know you better
          and better.

          Familiarity may have some impact on all the other reputation 
          categories and very noticeable impact on how NPCs talk to you. 

 - overhauled: NPC AI and village policy for dealing with breachers

        There tons of new rules and AI improvements considering how NPCs
        react when somebody misbehaves in their village. Minor breaches are 
        now dealt in less lethal way than previously, and in general NPCs 
        have far more options than just to attack and kill the offender. 
        Here's a summary of overhauled "UnReal World law and punishments":
    
        * Banishing

          Banishing is a general non-lethal way to deal with those who
          have committed minor breaches.

          Banishing procedure replaces the current standard of activity where
          villagers "just get angry" if you did something bad. Length of the
          banishing period varies depending on your violations. There may be 
          various preceding activities prior to banishing, but if it's not a
          murder you committed, you'll usually get away with it alive.

          When you get banished, for whatever reason, it goes like this:

          First NPCs will tell you that you have to leave.
          If their orders are ignored they attack, trying to remove you by 
          force. They don't hesitate to hurt you badly, but those who are 
          banished will not be killed. Forceful removal continues until you 
          escape willingly or have been knocked unconscious.

          And when you regain conciousness...you have been carried out of 
          the village and dumped into wilderness location of their choice. 
          So you are banished not only in theory, but in practice as well.

          If you return to the village during the banishing period you'll 
          get the same treatment again. And as the word gets around banishing
          can become very harsh punishment.
	
	* Dealing with violent troublemakers

          Starting a fight with villagers is now less lethal, provided that 
          no one gets killed. There are consequences, though, as attacking 
          the innocent is naturally unacceptable. 
             There are no changes in common behaviour where villagers defend
          each others if one of their own is attacked. The new thing is
          that when villagers now fight for self-defense they do not aim to 
          kill the brawler, but to give them troublemakers a beating they have
          begged for. How badly you'll be punished depends on how violently
          you have behaved and for how long you'll keep brawling. 
             When villagers have given you a justified crackdown they decide
          how to deal with you from there on. If you have fought the villagers
          only to a small degree they may consider the incident settled and
          allow you to stay - with a smudged reputation. If you have fought
          persistently and hurt them badly you'll get banished for some time.
             If you get defeated in a fight you started but never gave up,
          your life is spared but villagers may distrain some your weapons. 
          And they will also forcefully remove you from their village.

        * Dealing with offenders
	
          We know that there are certain things you are not allowed to do in 
          villages; setting traps, building fires, deconstructing buildings 
          or harvesting crops etc. There are no changes in this regard, but 
          NPCs now deal with offenders in a less lethal way than previously. 
          They do not try to beat you dead anymore over a bunch of snatched 
          turnips or inconsiderately built campfire.
          If you have committed an offense, villagers foremostly try to tell
          you off so that you'll hear it loud and clear what's allowed and 
          what's not. If you do not take their warnings seriously and continue
          mischievous behaviour you'll get banished from the village. 

        * Dealing with murderers

          It's simple and merciless; murderers will be killed. 

 - added: spreading of news
	
        Word of your good or bad deeds gets around and news spread across the
        villages. Spreading of news is simulated based on village population
        and assumed interaction between villages. News delivery time depends
        on distance between villages, likeliness of travelling inhabitants
        and importance of the news. Especially alarming news are delivered
        faster and people usually try to spread news of an attack to 
        neighbouring villages as fast as they can. Dead mean don't deliver 
        news, so to silence them all is to silence the news.

        News spread first from source village to closest neighbouring villages.
        From there on the news will be delivered to villages further away if
        necessary. So villages can acquire news through several intermediate
        sources. Number of intermediate sources affects to how people react
        to the news they have heard. It also matters how many sources are 
        telling the same news.

        For example:
        You are labeled as a notorious thief in certain village. When the 
        news about this reach the closest neighbouring village (secondhand 
        knowledge) people there most probably also treat you as a thief. In 
        the villages further away people may get suspicious towards strangers
        after hearing rumors about thieves (thirdhand, fourthand etc. 
        knowledge) - but they don't judge you right away.

        Upon entering a village where people have heard news about you they
        first come to check you out and talk their mind. You'll be told what
        they have heard and their attitude towards you comes clear.

  - improved: selecting living targets

        Whenever you need to select a distant target you can quickly switch
        selection between creatures in sight by pressing [+] and [-] keys.
        This is most handy in any situation where you want to select a 
        living target quickly; examining them, talking to them, throwing 
        things at them.
        [+] selects the next farthest creature.
        [-] selects the next nearest creature.

        Target selection dialog naturally shows these new keybindings so you 
        won't miss to use them when needed.

 - changed: key command to talk to someone is now [C]
 
        It's a keybinding of its own, no need to bring up extended commands.
        This was changed for the sake of fewer keystrokes. In addition, target
        selection cursor is located at nearest creature by default.

 - improved: NPC speech

        Your reputation and familiarity affects how NPCs talk to you. Now
        they  make it clear how they feel about you and can say the same 
        thing in different ways. Depending on your reputation they may 
        respond kindly or unkindly, praise you or call you with names. People
        can also react and speak differently depending on your culture. 
        Lots of NPC sentences have been rewritten. There's fresh speech to
        discover here and there.

        * When greeting NPCs there's now an option to introduce yourself. 

        * With familiarity reputation in effect villagers may also 
          occasionally shout varying greetings when you enter their village.

        * If you've done something that has angered the villagers you can
          find out the reason by talking to them. Instead of not responding
          at all, now they usually shout a short line about what has made
          them mad.

 - added: quicker access to companion commands

        Upon talking to your companion the list of companion commands is
        displayed first. This is because we most often talk to companions to 
        command them.
        To start a regular conversation you can choose general talk option 
        at the bottom of the companion commands menu.

 - added: hunting companions

        Companions can be commanded to attack a target of your selection. This
        makes your companions now hunt for real. It's also possible to 
        command your companions to attack hostile people, mostly Njerpez, who 
        have not noticed your party yet.

        Your companions will also notify you about a kill. They will stay
        beside the downed animal and shout for you to come over. This continues
        until you arrive, or they find more important tasks to do.

 - added: you need to keep your companions fed

        It's your duty to take care that your companion has enough food 
        during your time together. Use the usual "Deliver" chat option to 
        give more food to your companion. If your companion is running low 
        on food he/she will start talking and let you know about it. Or 
        you can keep an eye on your companion's inventory. Companions have 
        tendency to eat in the morning and at about same time as you do. For
        curiosity, there's also a message displayed when you see them 
        eating something. If your companions experience prolonged shortage 
        of food they may eventually leave you.

 - added: more versatile world location descriptions

        In addition to currently existing terrain and region name 
        information such as "Cliff at Steephill", locations on the world are
        now also descriped relative to cultural regions and specified with
        compass points.

        * Locations inside cultural regions are specified with eight
          compass points:
          "South-eastern Kaumo", "Northern Driik", "No man's land in 
           eastern Kiesse" etc.

        * Locations on no man's land outside cultural regions are descriped
          in relation to nearest neighbouring culture and specified with
          four cardinal directions: 
          "No man's land south of Koivula", "No man's land west of Driik" etc.
  
        New location descriptions appear in information box of character's
        current whereabouts, and whenever verbal information about certain 
        location is told for a reason or another.

        So we'll get these kind of location/region descriptions from now on:
        "Cliff at Steephill, Western Sartola"
        "Spruce mire at Murder woods, No man's land north of Kaumo"
        "Koivulais Village at Hightop, Northern Koivula"

 - overhauled: marking of time

        It was about time to get rid of the julian calendar. The marking of time
        is now changed to something quite different; a system that most probably
        has been in use in iron age finland.

        The year is divided into two halves, summer and winter. In between come
        midsummer and midwinter points. The periods between these four dates are
        of equal length consisting of 13 weeks with 7 days in each. Between the
        quarters the weeks are counted in reverse. That's because for ancient 
        people it was most important to know how far away the next important 
        transition period is.

        Months, moon periods, still exists and are important. The year is 
        divided into 12 lunar months, but the month names are now different; 
        they are english translations of finnish month names.

        We'll get this kind of dates from now on:
        Summer, Fallow Month, Day 1 of 4th week before midsummer point,
        Latter Winter, Center Month, Day 7 of 2nd week before summer

        After a while following the 'unreal calendar', calculating weeks in 
        reverse and thinking of year in two periods (summer and winter) with 
        mid points in each becomes strangely natural. And most importantly, 
        there's a whole new feeling in experiencing the passing of time - and 
        waiting for summer or preparing for winter. 

        There's also a game encyclopedia (F1) entry about MARKING OF TIME.

 - improved: character's death reason descriptions

        Death reasons are now formed in more complex and informative manner.
        The idea is to display more information about who/what caused the 
        injuries/situation that eventually lead to death of the character. 

        An example of pretty much most complex death reason description 
        would be:

        "He started to bleed after being hit by Kaumolais Hunter and fainted 
        from the bloodloss. While unconscious, he was hit by Kaumolais Sage
        and died from severe injuries."

        Death reasons are often shorter than this, but at least you always
        get to know what/who eventually did the finishing blow.

 - overhauled: list and archive of ancestors 
	
        Ancestors archive is now persistent. The list and statistics of your
        deceased characters will stay between version updates. 
        
        Extensive amount of data is collected and saved for each deceased 
        character. This data is not used that much just yet, but allows
        fascinating ancestor related features to be implemented in the 
        future. 

        * Memorial page, displayed after your character's death, tells the
          reason of death and character summary in fresh and more detailed 
          way.

        * 50 latest deceased characters are listed and stored in ancestors 
          archive. This data of the deceased will be utilized more 
          extensively in the future.

         * Upon viewing the list of ancestors you can dispay memorial page of
           each ancestor at will. 

         * TEASER OF THE FUTURE:
           Your characters won't die in vain. They leave a persistent mark. 
           Some day, in some version, you'll hear legends about them.
           And that's just for starters.

 - added: fresh images

        Start picture, one character portrait and couple of background 
        images. (Eventually we'll renew the remaining low-res outlook
        completely)

        Credits for additional image editing go to Paulo Marcelo from Brazil.

 - added: CTRL and 0 now toggles between normal and maxed out map view
	
        Previously CTRL+0 was used only to restore zoomed map view to normal.
        Now, if you use with when map view is already normal, it sets maxed out 
        view. Quick toggling between max/normal map view.

 - added: NPCs shut doors behind them

 - added: peaceful NPCs withdraw from your way

        This means easier moving in crowded villages.

 - added: starving pet dogs may eat carcassess

        So don't go hunting with a starving dog if you want to get hides of your
        kills intact.
 
 - modding add: [TERRAIN:] tag used in diy/biy requirements now recognizes 
                also exact terrain tile names

	This tag is used to specify required wilderness map terrain tile name
        regardless of location on zoomed-in map.
        
        Example entry:
        {[TERRAIN:Conifereous forest]} 'Be at conifereous forest'

        Notice the usage of both curly and square brackets and also DO use 
        your own defined 'requirement description'. 

 - modding add: [TILE:tile name] and [NEARBY_TILE:tile name] diy/biy 
                requirement tags

        These tags are used to specify required character's location related 
        zoomed-in terrain tile name.
        [TILE:] requires character to be located on specified tile.
        [NEARBY_TILE:] requires character to be located beside specified tile.

        Example entry:
        {[NEARBY_TILE:Spruce]} 'You need to be nearby a spruce'

        Notice the usage of both curly and square brackets and also DO use 
        your own defined 'requirement description'. 


 - modding fix: inability to add new western or eastern character portraits

        Number of portrait pictures for these two cultures was limited.
        This is fixed now.

 - fixed: smelling when the food is ready from far too great distances

        Now you can smell when the food is ready roughly from 2*smell/taste
        tiles away. This was broken so that you could also smell when smoked
        or dried food was ready - that's fixed, and not possible anymore.
        
 - fixed: "hurt, helpless and afraid" scenario sometimes caused an instant 
          death from too many wounds

 - fixed: burning stones

 - fixed: disappearing pets

        Heavy duty fix this time. If your pets still happen to disappear
        the game will notice it and auto-restores them on the fly. In addition
        you'll be given instructions to notify about the bug. 

 - fixed (again): pet/companion duplication

        This bug hasn't been as annoyingly regular as it used to be, but 
        there were few occasions where it could be triggered. These instances
        have been fixed now and hopefully we got completely rid of this bug.

 - fixed: fighting NPCs picking up useless items such as tree trunks

 - fixed: no sprite for buckler item

        Bucklers do have a basic shield sprite now. Previously discovered 
        bucklers remain spriteless.
 
 - fixed: picking up fish catch
        
        Detailed catch description will be displayed but now the fish will be
        located at your feet rather than auto-picked. You can then pick them 
        up at will.

 - fixed: pets eating food from villages

 - fixed: incorrect display of meat cuts being prepared

 - fixed: thrown staves getting stuck to target

 - fixed: clubs not working as treshing tools

 - fixed: sections of ice covered sea appeared as open water on zoomed in map

 - fixed: when pouring something to an empty container the source container 
          wasn't emptied expectedly and something always remained.

 - fixed: fish weight being re-randomized upon loading character

 - fixed: pets leashed to a tree still followed after zoom-out

	The bug occurred if tied pet was nearby the character upon zooming out.

 - fixed: discrete per-minute delays when doing tasks


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.17 - stable
Released: Aug-21-2013

** Saved characters from version 3.15-> are compatible with this version. **


 - added: prompts to abort task when attacked or a new NPC/animal enters
          your view

        There are four new instances where a prompt to abort current task 
        is displayed:

        1. A new NPC/animal enters your view. Companions and pets are always
           excluded unless they are aggressive at you.
        2. Somebody in your sight becomes aggressive.
        3. An aggressive NPC/animal in your sight gets within distance of 
           10 meters (5 tiles).
	4. Aggressive sounds are heard. 

        Prompts are displayed individually for every NPC/animal whose 
        behaviour meets the rules. Answering "No" will continue the task 
        without further prompt for the instance and NPC in question.
        In case of aggressive NPCs/animals far out of sight you'll be given 
        the first prompt when they enter your view (rule #1). If you don't 
        want to cancel the task, another prompt is given if you see them 
        getting within distance of 10 meters (rule #2).

        There are also newly added configuration options in urw_ini.txt to 
        adjust these settings separately for for humans and animals as 
        follows:

	[TASK_ABORT_ANIMALS:YES/NO/HOSTILE]
	[TASK_ABORT_HUMANS:YES/NO/HOSTILE]

	NO 	- never prompt to abort if these creatures enter your view
	YES 	- always prompt to abort if these creatures enter your view
	HOSTILE - prompt to abort only if this kind of hostile creatures 
                  enter your view

	For aggressive sounds of any origin there's a single configurable 
        option:
        [TASK_ABORT_SOUNDS:YES/NO]

 - added: if a weapon has only one attack aspect it is automatically 
          selected when trying hit your enemy

        For example: when hitting with a club you don't need to select the
        only available option (Blunt) manually.

 - balanced: super tired characters can sleep in the rain for short periods
             of time

        It's possible When the lack of sleep has reached "ready to drop" 
        level.

 - balanced: encumbrance penalty from armours and clothes being worn

        In case of armours and clothes being worn you start to suffer from
        encumbrance penalty only after their total weight exceeds one tenth 
        of character's weight. 
        For example: 160 lbs character can wear 16 lbs worth of armours and 
        clothes without any penalty from them specifically. 

 - balanced: skilled bowmen are now more accurate 

	Success based trajectory accuracy was too much fixed and your bow 
        mastery level didn't affect it. So 80% archer got more steady and 
        perfect shots than 40% archer, but the accuracy of those shots was 
        pretty much the same for both. Now your mastery level affects both 
        the ratio of succesfull shots and the accuracy of those shots. 
        Skilled bowmen can now expect better archery results. 

 - balanced: 'stance' physical condition requirement removed from angling

	Using fishing rod now requires one good arm.

 - added: AUTO_WADE configuration option (urw_ini.txt)

 	Do you want to wade automatically where possible. Possible values 
        are YES, NO and ASK (default).

 - added: shields can be used to block unarmed attacks

        Kicks, punches and all types of animal attacks can be attempted
        to block with a shield.

 - added: restore zoomed map view to normal by pressing CTRL and 0

        You can adjust map zoom level by mouse wheel, or by pressing
        CTRL and + (for zoom in), or CTRL and - (for zoom out).
        Pressing CTRL and 0 now restores the map view to 100%.

 - added: watercraft capacity restrictions

	You can transport either 40 different item stacks or 200 times the 
        weight of your watercraft. If your punt/raft is overloaded you
        can't row it and notification about it will be displayed.
        (Weight restriction is far from realistic, but we need to allow
        transporting logs with watercrafts until floating timber is
        implemented.)

 - added: new character portraits

        All the old character portraits have been replaced with new pictures.
        Characters migrated from version 3.16 may have changed their portrait.
        This is just for starters - portrait update is far from complete.
        Notice that some of the male portraits are used for more than one
        culture group (eastern, western, northern) and some NPCs may share
        your portrait. This is to be fixed in the future when more portraits 
        are added.
             
        Here's the credit list of picture contributors and sources in 
        no particular order:

        Simo Nousiainen/White Hand Crafts
        Sue Salminen
	Katarina Karppinen
        Zaden Kulkuri
        Dmitry Ankudinov
        neulakko.net
        Tiuku Talvela
        Andre Van Pinxteren

	Thank you!

 - fixed: trapped birds flying

 - fixed: blank wound treatment options

        Some of the most severe wounds have only one applicable treatment 
        option - that is intentional. But there was also blank treatment
        option which you couldn't select. These blank options have been 
        removed now. In the future there will be new treatment options 
        added for the most severe wounds.

 - fixed: placing items on newly sowed land reveals the sprout

 - fixed: felling trees not always unpausing properly

        Progress wasn't properly saved.

 - fixed: possibility to sleep while wading

 - fixed: possibility of instant drowning

        If a character with low swimming skill went swimming while fatigued 
        it was possible to drown instantly. Now there's always a chance to 
        swim for couple of turns before drowning no matter what.

 - fixed: dead pets wouldn't unleash if they were killed when tied to a tree 

 - fixed: rowing in winter increases fatigue

 - fixed: timbercraft skill might improve even if the task was impossible
          to perform

        This was most notable when splitting boards with poor axe.

 - fixed: few things that were possible with skis equipped

        You can't do the following things anymore while skiing OR with 
        skis equipped:

        - swim
        - wade
        - climb

 - fixed: stacking issues with tanned furs

	Tanned furs with same properties didn't always stack up properly.

 - fixed: skill point distribution glitches during character creation

	If you put a point into two skills and then took them off the 
        second skill still remained as having the point in use.

 - fixed: game-course reset after Watercourse task

	This was due to excess items on raft/punt.

 - fixed: clothmaking quality glitches

	Certain selfmade clothes came out in lesser quality than your
        success and raw material would have allowed. This was the case
        especially when making footwear.

 - fixed: crash potential when loading character with auto climbing enabled

 - fixed: deconstructing NPC built kotas didn't return furs

        Now you'll get those kota covers as well. They are often 
        reindeer furs of ragged quality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 3.17 - beta 4

 - added: escaping animals may attack if desperate/cornered 

        Escaping animals may now occasionally choose to attack their enemy
        in desperate situations. The more desperate the animal is the
        more easily it will attack. Animal's desperation builds up when it
        becomes cornered or doesn't seem to get rid of the pursuer by 
        escaping - and it also matters a lot if the animal is wounded, and
        how badly. There are numerous factors in the mix, but the outcome is 
        simple: 
        the greater the peril, the more likely animals choose to attack as 
        their last resort. 

        It is no longer possible to walk by cornered, wounded elk with no 
        risk at all. And in fact, this addition touches pretty much all the 
        animals there are. Even seemingly peaceful badgers or beavers may try
        to nip you if there's no other option.

 - added: [a]pply your fishing gear to use it

        You can start fishing by [a]pplying your fishing gear; rod, net, 
        club, trident etc. 
 
 - added: wading through shallow water

        If the water is shallow enough you can wade through it. Shallow areas
        can be found in any body of water, but usually you can wade only 
        few meters from the shore. Fords are an exception. 
        A confirmation to step into water will be asked upon entering shallow
        water. If you reach deep water while wading you'll be told 
        it's not possible to wade there. If you find a shallow area when 
        swimming, wading is automatically started.

 - added: fords

        Fords are shallow and narrow river sections where one can cross by 
        wading. Ford has a tile of its own which is noticeable on the
        world map. 
        MIGRATION NOTICE: fords are generated also for migrated world maps.
        In this case fords can appear only in river sections you have not 
        visited yet on zoomed in map level. So even the seemingly familiar 
        rivers are worth of re-exploring for finding fords.

 - added: islets, skerries and big rocks in the water

        These new terrain formations can be found in almost any body of water. 
        Islets and skerries appear most commonly by shallow lake sections.
        Big rocks sticking out of the water are characteristic for rivers, 
        rapids and fords. When crossing the waters by swimming or wading
        islets and skerries can be used as a place to rest for a while.
	However, some skerries may be impossible to climb on while in the 
        water. 

 - added: color of the water reflects its depth

        Deeper the water, deeper the color. Shallow water sections appear
        in lighter color. This way you can get a rough idea about depth of
        the water just by looking at it.

 - added: tie animals to trees

	You can now tie leashed animals to trees to secure them in place
        for a period of time. Just [a]pply the leash in use and dialog to 
        unleash or tie will appear. Tie option allows lashing the animal 
        to a nearby tree or fence. Leash item will then appear on the 
        ground and the animal will stay put.
        
        To untie an animal, simply pick up the leash and carry on.

 - added: command your dogs without eye contact

        Even if your dog is out of sight you can still try to command it.
	Upon using talk option (#t) a list of pets you can shout to will 
        appear. Dogs that are out of sight can be commanded to attack and
        and come. Rest of the dog commands still need an eye contact.

 - added: dogs notify their master about a kill 

        Dogs will now stay beside their kill and bark in order to call their
        master at the scene. This helps you to find the carcass if your dog 
        has downed an animal far away. Dogs keep on barking beside the kill
        quite persistently until their master arrives, or they find more 
        important tasks to do eg. another prey/enemy to attack. 

 - removed: phobia display from character profile [P]

        Phobias have not actually been truly in effect for some time.
        Character's mental profile will be implemented in better detail in 
        the future.

 - removed: climbing trees on wilderness map

        It was far too easy and unrealistic method to spot wildlife on
        wilderness map. 

 - added: observing wildlife from high terrain

        Wildlife can be observed on wilderness map from high terrain such as
        hills, cliffs and mountains. Spotting wildlife this way depends on
        your character's eyesight and animal size. The better your eyesight 
        the further away you can spot animals, and smaller the animal
        the more difficult it is to spot from long distance. Even if it's
        possible to see large areas from good vantage points you shouldn't
	assume that you can spot all the animals within the view. 

 - added: weapon usage restrictions with injured arms

        You can't wield items with badly injured hands. Items will slip from
        your grasp if the hand wielding them becomes unusable. Wielded 
        weapon slots are assigned as follows:
        Primary = right hand
        Secondary = left hand

        If only your right (primary) hand is in usable condition you can
	wield items with your left (secondary) hand. If your both hands are 
        unusable you can not wield anything.

 - added: proper rules for two-handed weapon usage in melee

	Any weapon can be used one-handed, but weapons intended for 
        two-handed use suffer from penalty if wielded in one hand. This
        penalty depends on weapon design and applies to your skill mastery
        level and weapon impact. Heavy two-handed weapons such as 
        battleaxes and battleswords can have penalty up to -30% whereas 
        light spears and such may be only -10% more difficult to use with 
        one hand. 
        
        You'll be notified about this extra penalty when using two-handed 
        weapon with one hand only. Examining weapons with [i]nventory 
        command will also tell you the preferred handmode and resulting
        penalty for using it one-handed. Clumsy

        Two-handed weapons are used with both hands when you have only 
        that one weapon wielded. If you have two weapons wielded, each 
        weapon is used one-handed. 

 - added: levels of effort and physical condition requirements for ordinary
          tasks

        We do know that for example fighting and running is already 
        fatiguing in the game, but now also ordinary physical activities 
        have been given individual levels of effort. Moreover, your 
        character now also needs to meet specific physical condition
        requirements to perform certain tasks. These two additions together
        make living in UnReal World quite a bit more hardcore than it used
        to be. 

        * Level of effort has effect on character's fatigue accumulation
          and nutrition need. Hard work exerts more energy and burns that
          much more calories, making you get hungry faster. And the harder
          the work is, the more fatiguing it naturally is. For ordinary
          physical activities there are fives levels of effort: light, 
          moderate, hard, heavy and very heavy. 

          If character's fatigue level reaches maximum (100%) during any
          pausable physically demanding he/she is considered too fatigued 
          to continue and the task is automatically stopped. 

        * Physical condition requirements

          Injuries affect to usability of your body in order to perform 
          physical activities. This is most notable with limb injuries as
          usable arms, or hands, are often required. Being able to stand
          is also crucial in many ordinary activities.
          All the physical activities now have individual physical 
          condition requirements, and failing to meet them prevents you 
          from doing the task. Combination of wound types and level of 
          injury determines whether a certain limb or bodypart is usable or
          not. 

          Level of effort of activity to be performed has also some effect
          on how much injury in required bodyparts is tolerated.
          For example: It may not possible to swing an axe (fell a tree) 
          with badly injured arms, but you can still use them to set a 
          light trap.

          Basic physical condition requirements are categorized as follows:
          one / both arms - referring to whole limb from shoulder to hand.
          one / both hands - with forearm/elbow also in usable condition.
          stance - being able to stand.

          There are emergency options for certain tasks. If something is 
          usually done with both hands, you may be able to do it with only
          one usable hand in emergency situation. It will be more 
          difficult and slow to complete, but plausible. 
 
          To get an idea about level of detail, here are some examples of
          newly adjusted effort levels and physical condition requirements
          for certain tasks:

          - threshing:
            When done with flail, stance and and both arms are required, 
            hard effort. Otherwise one good hand is required, light effort.

          - preparing soil:
            Heavy effort, both arms and stance required.

          - grinding flour: 
            Both arms required, moderate effort. 
            One-armed possibility in case of emergency.

          - building a fire:
            Both hands, light effort.
            One-armed possibility in case of emergency.

          - digging:
            Stance and both arms required. Heavy effort.

          - setting/disarming traps:
            Stance and both arms required for bigger traps, 
            one good hand for small traps. 

          - cutting & skinning:
            Both arms required. Level of effort depends on animal size and
            can vary from light to hard. 
           
          - fishing:
            Net fishing requires both arms and stance.
            Angling and maul fishing require at least one good arm. 

 - modding add: modifiable levels of effort and physical condition 
                requirements for do-it-yourself crafts and building

        There are two new tags to be used in biy_* and diy_* headers:
      
        [effort:value] defines level of effort.

        Use value from 0 to 5 as follows:
        0 - easy (not fatiguing at all)
        1 - light 
        2 - moderate
        3 - hard
        4 - heavy
        5 - very heavy


        [phys:tags separated by commas] 

        Defines physical condition requirements. 

        Possible tags are:
        stance - you need to be standing
        arm - one arm from shoulder to hand in usable condition
        arms - boths arms from shoulder to hand in usable condition
        hand - one hand (plus forearm and elbow) in usable condition
        hands - both hands (plus forearms and elbows) in usable condition
        one-armed - it's possible to perform the task also with one arm/hand,
                    but it will be slow and difficult.
	
        As an example, here's diy header for crafting javelin:
        .Javelin. [effort:1] [phys:hands,one-armed] *COMMON* /30/ [patch]

        So it's light effort, both hands are needed for crafting, but this
        can be done with one hand only in emergency situation.

 - added: zoomable map view

        You can adjust map zoom level by mouse wheel, or by pressing
        CTRL and + (for zoom in), or CTRL and - (for zoom out).

        There are four zoom levels: 100%,80%,60%,50%. Zoomed out map view
        can be very useful for it displays larger viewspace of the area.
        Certain zoomed out modes can be a bit laggy compared to 100% view
        but this will be optimized in the future.

 - added: new "time counter" dialog

        Time counter dialog which pops up when doing time consuming tasks
        has a fresh outlook. The new outlook features level of effort and 
        progress bar displayed.

 - added: pausable building

        It is now possible pause and continue any building jobs at will.
	You don't have to finish for example a section of wall at once 
	but can select your working hours freely. Continuing a building
        job is possible after 5% of the construction has been completed. 
        To pause a building job simply cancel the process. The new time
        counter dialog will tell you when a certain job can be continued
        after cancelling. 

        There's new "Continue paused building" option under BUILDING menu - 
        that's how you continue working with unfinished buildings and
        constructions.

        Deconstructing is also pausable.
        
 - improved: felling trees

        * Felling trees is pausable. You can start, cancel and continue
          at will. 

        * The tree in front of you is automatically selected. If there's
          none you'll be asked for a direction.

 - fixed: when hauling items towards an obstacle time was spent despite of
          of the fact that your character didn't move

 - fixed: animal same item limit when packing

        If you packed more than 255 same items on an animal some of them
        disappeared. This is fixed so that more than 255 same items will be 
        now distributed in separate item stacks.

 - fixed: broken "fistful/bunch/pinch of" item name definitions in cookery 
          recipes

	Recipes using item names with said definitions were broken.
        "Fistful/bunch/pinch of" definitions are working now, but you
        can (and should) use core item names like:
        .Blueberries. (instead of .Fistful of blueberries.)

        NOTICE: This was announced to be fixed in 3.16 but was still broken.

 - fixed: unsafe uninstaller script in Windows

        Uninstaller removed the whole directory tree recursively, assuming
        that installation folder was game specific. 
        If the game was installed to a folder with existing subfolders 
        these all were wiped out upon uninstalling. 

        Uninstaller doesn't delete character folders by default anymore.
        For any existing character folder you will be asked if you want 
        to remove it or not.
         
 - fixed: ghost injuries upon waking up

        Injury meter displayed -10% right after waking up even though you 
        were not injured. These injuries disappeared with your next move.
       
 - fixed: three skiing related issues

        1. Now you can remove skis also by [T]ake off command. 
        2. Now you can't ski while crawling.
        3. Now you can't ski without ski stick.

 - fixed: plant will be after a day, but it's not!

        If a plant was said to be ready for harvesting "after a day", 
        the next day it was said to be ready for harvesting "after a 
        week". 

 - fixed: oath of iron ritual worked for staves

 - fixed: aggressive animals occasionally kept on fruitless, repetitive 
          attack-escape loop 

        They did constantly change their mind...
        "[Animal] attacks at you!", "[Animal] escapes!"
	...but did not make any attacks in between.

 - fixed: bugged self-made food prices

	Price of self-made foods was often derived from the last added 
        ingredient in the recipe. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 3.16 - stable
Released: Apr-27-2013

** Saved characters from version 3.15-> are compatible with this version. **


 - improved: wielding a new weapon when both hands are in use

	If you wield a weapon when both hands in use your secondary weapon is 
        automatically taken off and the new weapon is wielded as a secondary
        weapon.
 
 - fixed: possibility to climb while hauling items

	This was not intentional, and doesn't work anymore.
	[p]ush items to bring a heavy load on the other side of a fence etc.

 - fixed: dogs being attracted by baited traps

	They did not enter traps, but failed to notice safer food options
        nearby.

 - fixed: dogs eating from cellars

 - fixed: fat not accepted as raw meat

	It's accepted now..for those who want their fat cooked.

 - added: simple configuration file to customize some game options 

	View and edit urw_ini.txt in your installation folder to customize
	the following options: 

	- Keep examine distant location (F3) dialog active for repeated 
          selections until cancelled?
	- Ask to climb fences, or climb them automatically?
	- Ask a confirmation to exit zoomed in map if dogs or companions 
          are left behind?

 - fixed: dogs can hurt animals in a tree

 - fixed: occasional meat description changes if different types of meat was
          prepared at the same location

 - balanced: dogs - the price and behaviour

	Changes apply mostly to their hunting behaviour, which resembled more
        that of a well-trained war dog rather than a common hunting dog.

	* Hunting large animals
	
          Dogs now primarily aim to block animal's escape route by heading 
          in front of it in order to make it stop or to change its course.
          Most importantly hunting dogs now bark in alarm when they've got 
          the animal cornered or momentarily stopped. 

        * Hunting small animals
          
          Same tactics as with large animals, but dogs also tend to make 
          occasional attacks and usually manage to injure their prey quite
          effectively.

        * Hunting aggressive animals

          No relevant changes. Dogs fight as bravely as they always do, with
          some individual variations in the mix. If cornered animal turns 
          aggressive, the dog will fight it. If the prey animal escapes again,
          the dog tries to block its escape route and lets you know about it 
          by barking.

        * Dogs are now more valuable. Their price is tripled.

 - added: NPC/animal fatigue information displayed

	Upon looking at creatures (F3) their fatigue level is displayed:
	"It looks [slightly fatigued/fatigued/very fatigued/breathless]." 

 - added: "Yes/No" dialog to ask if you want to climb the fence when you 
          move on it.

 - added: hide quality depends on how damaged the carcass is

	If the carcass to be skinned is partially eaten or otherwise damaged
	the quality of resulting hide is accordingly lower, and skinning 
        is more difficult.

	* It's worthwhile for fur hunters to bring the animal down quickly
          and effectively to prevent ruining the hide with excess strikes.

	* The smaller the animal the less strikes are need to damage its'
	  hide. 

	* In general edge and point attacks pierce the hide most effectively
          so blunt weapons are something to consider for knocking the small 
          game dead.

	* Location of the wounds also affects to possible hide damage. You 
          can get a perfect hide even if the carcass has been beheaded or 
          misses a hoof or two, but dozen of spear strikes in its abdomen 
          doesn't look good in finished hide. 

	* There's a damage tag displayed upon looking at the carcass:
          harmed/torn/hacked/mangled/crisly
	  
	  If there's no tag displayed the carcass is intact in terms of
          utilizing the hide.

 - fixed: cancelling aiming zone/weapon aspect in counterstrike

 - fixed: False skinnig message: "The [NULL] is the right tool here, but 
          suffers from..." 

 - fixed: "hides & skins" not listed by default when making cords

 - fixed: purchasing multiple animals within one talk session only gives 
          you one

	Talk session now ends after each completed animal trade. You need to 
        talk again to trade for another animal.

 - fixed: sacrificing unknown plants reveals their true name

 - fixed: leashed animals not always following you upon zooming out

	If they were stuck behind trees, walls, other creatures, they
        would stay on zoomed in maps. 

 - added: zoom in/out confirmation dialog if your companions/dogs are getting
          left behind

	If companions or dogs can't follow you upon zooming in/out you'll be
        notified and asked if you really want to leave the area. 

 - added: name of your leashed pet is displayed in character's inventory with
          the leash in use

 - added: press [ESC] to skip "more" prompt in message display

	Rest of the messages for given turn will be displayed without pausing
        on every screenful of messages.

 - changed: key command to show character profile screen is now [P] 

 - removed: access to other profiles (rituals, skills etc.) from character 
            profile screen has been removed

	It wasn't that useful.

 - fixed: non-stacking items
	
	Traded items, or items gotten from NPCs, did not always stack with 
        same kind of self made items.
	
 - fixed: animals occasionally "freezing" beside traps without entering nor
          passing them

 - fixed: occasional plant alteration during threshing

	You threshed some rye, but got blueberries. 
	(It was about berry eating animals nearby messing up the data)

 - fixed: when tanning skins rinsing and soaking can degrade the skin quality

	This wasn't intentional. Those tanning stages now do not affect the 
	skin quality - they are not so challenging considering the whole
 	tanning process.

 - fixed: numpad issues after switching tasks

 - fixed: sleeping disorders

        Short, interrupted sleeps were often more refreshing than long 
        uninterrupted sleeps.

  - added: sleeping on furs for extra warmth and comfort

        The fur needs to be of decent size to act as proper ground cover or
        blanket. Several smaller furs can be used instead of one big pelt.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 3.16-beta 3 
Released: Apr-4-2013

** Saved characters from version 3.15-> are compatible with this version. **

 - added: automatic item type filtering for variety of item selections 

	Automatic item filtering was most notably missing from crafting 
        selections. Item filtering in crafting equipment selection follows the 
        general idea to list only applicable item types by default. 

 - added: drinking messages

	Instead of just letting you know if your thirst was extinguished you 
        are also told of having sipped, drank or gulped the liquid in question 
        - depending on the amount drank.

 - added: options to feed your dog

	Dogs will eat food on the ground within their reach when they are 
        hungry, but sometimes you want them to eat on your command. There are 
        now two options to awake your dogs appetite.

	a) throw food at your dog 
	   
           Choose your dog as a target. As long as you are throwing food it's 
           considered a feeding option, not a missile attack.

	b) talk to your dog and command it to "eat"

	Both options will encourage your dog to immediately search for food and
        eat it.	Your dog will still decide what it will eat, so you can't feed 
        it something it doesn't like. Your dog also avoids overeating and 
        prefers to go for the nearest foodstuff within its reach.

 - added: pet dogs now follow you without a leash

	You don't have to leash your pet dogs anymore, they will happily follow 
        you. However, sometimes it may be reasonable to leash your dog to keep 
        it close by.

 - added: options to command your pets

	Talk to your pet to command it. The following commands are available:

        * attack

          Command your dog to attack selected creature. Dogs will attack only 
          wild animals or hostile NPCs on command. 

	* eat

          Encourage your dog to search for food and eat it. 

	* come

          Tell your dog to come at you. Freely moving dogs may wander further
          away from the player character so sometimes it's useful to tell them 
          to come at you. 

        * name

	  Give your pet a name. 

	* stay 

	  Tell your dog to stay put. It will stay in one place for some time, 
          but eventually starts following you again. If the dog is told to 
          stay, it won't follow you when zooming out from the local map.
         
	* follow 
	
	  If you've told your dog to stay put, use this command to tell it's 
          now okay to follow you again.

 - changed: checks to determine if your pets/companions can follow you upon
            zooming out from local map

        Previously your pets/companions were magically able follow you in
        all occasions regardless of their whereabouts on zoomed in map. If you
        zoomed out, they always zoomed out with you. Now a waypoint check is
        made for pets/companions that are following you to determine if they
        actually can reach your location and are able to follow you. If they
        are not able to reach your location they will stay on zoomed in map.
        Coming back and grouping up again is naturally possible. 
        Now that dogs follow you without a leash these changes are necessary,
        but they also bring team spirit up to a new level:
 
        * Your dogs will stay penned if you zoom out when outside the pen.
          If you are in the pen the dog can naturally reach your location 
          and will zoom out with you. 

	* If your pet/companion is caught in the fight they are unlikely able
          to reach your location when you zoom out. Therefore you can't 
          leave your fighting pets/companions behind and assume that they
          will appear next to you on the wilderness map after zooming out.

	* If your pet/companion is far away and their route back to you is
          obstructed, they may not be able to reach you when you zoom out.
          In difficult terrain, and in difficult situations, you need to group
          up to ensure that the whole party will travel together.

	* In general pets/companions have no trouble reaching your location
          when zooming out, even if they are hundred of meters away. But 
          sometimes you need to pay attention and think to yourself that
	  you don't leave your companion.

 - added: descriptions of known creatures shortened in game messages 

        In case of people and animals you know by name their descriptions are
        shortened in many game messages. For example, "Ruurikki attacks 
        Rudolph." [now] instead of "Ruurikki the kaumolais woodsman attacks 
        the reindeer" [previously].

 - fixed: companions with axes nagging about requiring proper tree-felling 
          equipment 

 - fixed: foodstuff alteration/blankage upon spoiling

	This bug manifested itself by showing blank food names while item count
        was still displayed correcly. The bug occurred only with foods, and 
        quite often with those in cellar. I blame the spoilage routines for it, 
        but this was only 99.9% confirmed. If you ever encounter a similar bug
        again be sure to report as soon as possible.

 - fixed: oath of iron ritual occasionally removing or transforming selected 
          weapon

 - fixed: oath of iron ritual working for javelins

 - fixed: when drinking milk the amount consumed wasn't relative to character's
          thirst

	1 pound of milk was always drank, regardless of your thirst. Now you 
        drink only the amount needed to quench your thirst.

 - fixed: occasional problems with cutting/skinning a carcass from an adjacent
          tiles

 - fixed: being able to buy animals in a village from your party members

 - fixed: waking up to "strange noises" if you were [R]unning when going to 
          sleep

 - fixed: "hoard wisely" warning message popping up without proper reason

	As this now works as intended be sure not to overlook the message 
        anymore - it is displayed if zoommap item limit is soon to be reached.
	It's hard work to reach item limits, but it's possible for example by 
        creating huge and dense fields. If you are unwisely hoarding too much
        stuff at too small area this warning message advices you to spread 
        your stuff over a larger area. 

 - fixed: movement sound for walking being played when swimming

 - fixed: unable to wield weapons picked from your companions

 - fixed: picking up items from under NPCs not possible because of "this is not
          your pack animal" check.

	Now you can also pick up items from under your pack animals:
        just cancel unpacking dialog and picking up items from the 
        ground will start.

 - fixed: watercrafts disappearing after zoom in/zoom out sequence if you 
          didn't make any moves in between

 - fixed: penalty statistics (from carried load) not updating immediately after
          unpacking animals 

 - fixed: 'Cover for kota' selected automatically 

	This is was not intended. Most often you want to manually select the
        hides to use rather than have the best ones automatically selected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 3.16-beta 2 
Released: Mar-5-2013

** Saved characters from version 3.15 are compatible with this version. **

 BETA NOTICE:

        This is a beta release. Listed improvements are to be extended further
        in releases to follow. Many of the intended features for the UI and 
        AI have not yet made it into this beta release.

 LICENSING NOTICE:

	UrW is now donation based freeware game. 
        Free to play - donate to keep it that way.
	See the link below:
	http://www.jmp.fi/~smaarane/urw_donation-based.html

 - fixed: game freezing upon map item limit being reached

	This occurred when character went to sleep or left/entered a map. 
        There is a zoommap limit of 2000 unique items on 50x50 (tiles) area. 
        Upon approaching this limit the game tries to clean the area by
        removing unnecessary stuff like old bloodscapes and tracks. If the 
        clean up failed, and there were truly excess number of items, the game
        fell into endless loop. 

 - added: warning message if zoommap item limit is soon to be reached

	It's hard work to reach item limits, but it's possible for example by 
        creating huge and dense fields. If you are unwisely hoarding too much
        stuff at too small area there's now a warning message which advices 
        you to spread your stuff over a larger area.

 - fixed: sticky ALT-key after switching windows by alt-tabbing 

 - fixed: hiding being sometimes not possible even though no one was 
          around to see you

 - fixed: it was possible pick up a punt/raft while rowing

 - added: '=' key (equals sign) works as an alternate key for '+'

	Small but significant laptop friendly addition.

 - added: item selection dialog remembers the page and location of your last
	  selection 

	Upon repeating any item handling command the item selection dialog 
        opens from the page and location of your last selection. This makes 
        it easier to handle inventories with several pages as you don't have
        to scroll back where you were.

	For example:
	You are picking up items from a huge pile and choose something from
        a stack on the third page to see if you can still carry something. 
        Let's say you can, and you want a few more of those. Using pick up 
        command again now automatically scrolls the item selections dialog
        to your previous location.

 - fixed: broken cow & sheep audio definitions -> samples were not played
    
 - fixed: unnecessarily long human meat descriptions causing crashes

	Occasional buffer overflows and crashes occurred after handling human
        meat or cutting up NPCs. Now cutting NPCs for meat gives you simply 
        "human cuts" instead of cuts with full description (e.g. "Kaumolais 
        adventurer cuts").     

 - fixed: pressing [esc] to skip optional item selection (e.g. seasoning in 
          cookery, herbs in wound treatment) cancelled the following task as 
          well.

	This was related to keyboard repeat delay and occurred only on some 
        keyboards.

 - fixed: pets dogs occasionally refusing to eat the food available

	Dogs preferred raw meat a bit too much. If there was raw meat at the
        area (eg. in your cellar) they refused to eat anything else. Now dogs
        will happily eat the closest foodstuff available even if it's not 
        their favourite kind of snack.

Version: 3.16-beta
Released: Feb-20-2013

** Saved characters from version 3.15 are compatible with this version. **

 BETA NOTICE:

        This is a beta release. Listed improvements are to be extended further
        in releases to follow. Many of the intended features for the UI and 
        AI have not yet made it into this beta release.

 LICENSING NOTICE:

	UrW is now donation based freeware game. 
        Free to play - donate to keep it that way.
	See the link below:
	http://www.jmp.fi/~smaarane/urw_donation-based.html

 - improved: [m]oving items

        Upon using [m]ove command you'll now select items to haul along from
        the new item selection dialog which allows smooth and easy selection 
        of multiple items.
	Now, wherever the character moves, selected items will be hauled along.
        Depending on weight and number of hauled items there will be fatigue 
        fatigue accumulation and/or extra time spent upon each turn. Hauling 
        is stopped and items left on the ground upon using [m]ove command 
        again.	

 -  added: [p]ush/pack command

        Push/pack is used to move items at your feet to an adjacent tile, or
        to pack an animal. As [m]ove command now hauls items along with your
        character this separate command was required to cover moving items
        to adjacent tile/animal.

 - added: new item selection dialog 

        This is a core element improvement which makes item selection more
        convenient. There are new keybindings to cover item filtering and 
        multiple item selection so pay attention to dialog information. 

	* all item selections are processed through the new item selection 
          dialog. This includes selecting items on the ground or from NPC's 
          inventory. Old-school pick up and move dialogs are gone.

        * items are always listed in groups

        * possibility to filter the list of viewed items

          You can filter the list of items so that only certain item types are
          are displayed. This makes it easier to find the item you are looking
          for; weapons, armours, food, timber etc.

	* only the applicable item types are displayed by default

          When you want to eat something, your foods are displayed
          When you want to wear something, your armours are displayed.
          And so on...

	* multiple item selection

          In many cases it's possible to select multiple items. For example, 
          you can now drop, wear, take off or pick up items in much more 
          convenient way. Selecting all items at once is also quick and easy. 

 - little but significant user-interface and human-computer interface 
   improvements: 

	* filling containers

        If there's a water source in front of you the selected container will 
        be automatically filled with water. If not, you'll be asked for a 
        direction which can be either an animal to milk or a water source.

        * eating

        After eating something the item selection dialog will prompt you for 
        another item to eat only if you are still hungry. 

        * drinking 

        When drinking water you'll drink enough to quench your thirst with a 
        single [q]uaff command.
        Options to drink raindrops or eat snow to reduce your thirst have 
        been removed. (In the future there will be options to melt snow and
        fill a container with rainwater by leaving it outside when it's 
        raining.)

  	* unpacking animals 

        If certain items are too heavy to be picked up directly you'll be 
        asked if you want to unpack troubled items onto ground. 

	* picking up items from location of harvestable plant

	Most often you want to pick either harvest or items, but rarely the 
        both at once. So you'll be asked if you want to pick the harvest. 
        Yes - harvesting starts and no items will be picked up.
        No - items are picked up.

	* [F3] dialog (examine distant location) keeps up until cancelled
            
	So you can examine several locations in a row without having to bring
	the dialog up in between.

 - improved: pet dog AI

	* You need to feed your pet dogs. They'll bark in hunger to let you
          know when they are hungry and then eat what's in their reach on the
          ground. Dogs eat variety of food: meat, fish, cooked food.

	* Dogs now alert their owner by barking in alarm if they spot predators.
          A good watch dog can be very valuable in protecting your domestic 
          animals - and yourself. Loudly barking dog can wake you up from your 
          sleep before a pack of wolves enters your pen, or it can alert you 
          about a threat ahead during your hunting trips.

 - improved: herd behaviour of animals

	Every pack/flock/herd of gregarious animals now has a leader - a
        dominant animal. Herd members can act individually but they travel
        together and aim to stay together. In some cases individual herd 
        members may trigger tasks for the whole herd to participate.
        If the leader is killed (or lost) the remaining herd picks a new
        dominant animal for themselves.

 - added: prey-predator relationships

        Basically all the animals now react to presence of other species. 
        This makes prey animals to avoid and escape the predators. 
        Sometimes you may get to witness a hare escaping a lynx across your 
        yard etc. There's countless variety of incidents this improvement can
        trigger.

 - added: species specific diets and feeding behaviour of animals

	This inlcudes major animal AI improvements and additions making their
	behaviour a lot more meaningful. Animal AI is effective regardless
        of your character's presence so you may occasionally find carcasses
        and picked (eaten) plants in the wild.

	* Animals now have values for energy reserves, energy compumption and
          hunger. When hungry, they follow their species specific feeding
          behaviour trying to find food that suits their diet.
	
	* There are herbivores, carnivores and omnivores. In some cases diets 
          can be highly varied consisting of several different prey animals,
          plants, mushrooms, berries etc. 

	* Carnivores actively search, hunt, kill and eat their prey. They 
          also tend to return to feast on the carcass later on. 

	* Wolves hunt in packs. This is very effective and there's usually
          very little the prey can do to survive from the attack.

	* Your livestock is now in danger of being attacked by predators.
          Desperately hungry or courageous predators are able to jump over 
          fences if needed.

	* Herbivores (and omnivores) search and eat variety of plants 
          specific to their diet. Sometimes animals may also get interested
          in what your garden has to offer.

	There's countless variety of incidents this improvement can
        trigger.

 - improved: wound treatment result of serious injuries

	Serious injuries were a bit too easy to treat and the results were 
        pretty much always desirable. Now there is more variety in treatment
        results and certain wounds may start to bleed again if treated
        poorly. So you need to consider more carefully if you truly wish to 
        poke that deep cut every other day with a low PHYSICIAN skill. 

 - added: zoommap maintenance 
	
	Long-living characters often started to suffer from huge savegames 
	as all the visited zoom maps are being saved. This made zoom in/out
 	laggy and consumed lots of disk space. Now zoommaps are maintenanced 
        upon reaching map data cap and unimportant maps are deleted in the 
        process. Maps are considered unimportant if they haven't been visited
        for a year and/or do not contain creatures, man-made items or 
        constructions. 
        If your old character is already burdened with excess map data the
        maintenance will start after loading the character first time
        in this version. Otherwise the maintenance will be executed when the 
        map data cap is reached during the gameplay. 

 - balanced: wandering Njerpez and their war camps

	Wandering Njerpez are most commonly encountered in the east, but
	they were setting their war camps all around the world regardless
        of the territory. This sometimes happened with a disturbing frequency. 
        Now the Njerpez will set up war camps only in the eastern parts of the 
        world and less frequently. Occasional Njerpez scouts can be still
        encountered even in the north and west, but not in war parties with 
        built camps.

 - fixed: burying unknown plants in the bog reveals their identity 

 - fixed: broken "fistful/bunch/pinch of" item name definitions in cookery 
          recipes

	Recipes using item names with said definitions were broken.
        "Fistful/bunch/pinch of" definitions are working now, but you
        can (and should) use core item names like:
        .Blueberries. (instead of .Fistful of blueberries.)

 - fixed: partial furs having full value

 - fixed: arrows flying through closed doors

	This happened very rarely, but was still possible.

 - fixed: message output when preparing soil wasn't possible

	Preparing soil isn't possible for example on marshy soil or bedrock.
        However the message output here has bugged not referring to tile in
        question giving confusing messages.

 - fixed: PHYSICIAN-skill not improving no matter how much you used it

 - fixed: tracks not disappearing ever

	Tracks older than a month will now disappear permanently. Also tracks 
        left on the ice will disappear when the ice melts.
	
 - fixed: "phantom tools" appearing when deconstructing buildings

	If you used tools on the ground when building something these tools
        appeared as a phantom, zero count copies when deconstruting your work. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.15 (patch 1) 
Released: Jan-04-2013

 - fixed: pets/companions duplicating

	If your earlier character suffered from this bug and there are 
        duplicated pets/companions around, butcher them all before continuing 
        your adventures. As it may be hard to recognize which one is duplicate
        you should butcher all but one of each species of your pets/companions.

        If you haven't travelled with pets/companions before this patch release 
        then everything is in order with you character.

Version: 3.15 - stable
Released: Dec-24-2012
** Saved characters from previous version are compatible with this version. **

 - fixed: being able to degrade developed skills in skill improvement 
          game-course reward 

        This opened an exploit to gain more skill improvement options.
            
 - fixed: bug potential when craftsman prevents you from crafting in his 
          storehouse

	The bug in question was item duplication. 

 - fixed: object maintenance routines 

	Internal object maintenance routines are something you rarely encounter,
	but with long-living characters object structures may be triggered for 
        automatic cleansing once in a while. These routines were bugged causing
        unpredictable item losses and corruption.

 - fixed: companions/pets occasionally dying upon zooming in at area with enemies

 	This mostly occurred when entering Njerpez camps. 


** Changelog for 3.15-beta2 released on Dec-1-2012 starts here. **


 - two of the male character portraits (one western, one northern) replaced with
   fresh ones. Your migrated character may have changed his appearance.

 - fixed: crash potential upon delivering foodstuff with long description to NPCs

 - fixed: fish prices were bugged, not relative to their nutritional value & weight

	Notice that the fish your character has caught earlier remain to carry 
	faulty prices.

 - fixed: faulty item prices in trading 

	Item prices in trading occasionally received quite random values. Your
	character may have experienced confusing, unrealistically cheap or 
	expensive deals. The actual item price data wasn't bugged here, but 
	NPC AI was.

 - fixed: grinding grains in a large container not proceeding correctly

	The maximum amount of grains you can grind at once is 4 lbs. If you 
	selected for example a bag that contained more than 4 lbs grinding 
	wouldn't proceed further.

 - fixed: containers disappearing upon grinding flour

 - fixed: game freezing upon picking up young leaves when there were other items on
	  the same tile

 - fixed: sneaking on wilderness map - not possible anymore

	It was kind of an exploit to be able to hide and sneak on the wilderness map
	as it allowed improving in STEALTH with no NPCs around.

 - fixed: crafting in a storehouse-exploit

	If you crafted something in a storehouse the items there could used 
	(exploited) as your tools/raw materials. Crafting in storehouses is 
	forbidden now.
	
 - fixed: automatic item selection for tying equipment/ropes

	Now tying equipment/rope always needs to be selected manually from 
        character's inventory. This fixes the annoyances where auto-selection 
        could pick your pet leash (in use) - or your precious ropes when you would
        have wanted to use cords.

 - fixed: branch/spruce twig mess when constructing a trap-pit with sharp stakes

        Spruce twigs were accepted as branches, which caused auto-item selection 
        sometimes to fail. Now the requirements are strict and clear: "branches" 
        means branches, and "spruce twigs" means spruce twigs.

 - fixed: bugged estimated planting time calculations when trying to plant 
          something too early 

	The game often nagged about needing to wait for another two weeks, and 
        then suddenly in the next morning it was possible to plant.


** Changelog for 3.15-beta released Oct-28-2012 starts here. **
** The following are the major new features in version 3.15  **


 - improved: required item and raw material selection in crafting/building

	Items, tools and raw materials required for crafting/building are
        selected automatically if they can be found from character's inventory
        or nearby on the ground. Automatic item selection always uses the
        best tools and raw materials available. Only the weight based
        materials need to be selected manually from character's inventory,
        ie. "4 lbs of fur".

 - improved: skill improvement options for a new character

        The basics stay unchanged: there are number of option points to be
        used to improve your skills. However, you may not only improve your
        skills but also degrade them. [+] and [-] keys used to change skill'
        values. There are two new character generation methods: "easy" and
        "too easy". These two new methods allow to degrade a skill below its'
        initial level to gain extra option points. The original character
        generation options ("quick and easy" & "custom") haven't changed.

        The new character generation methods allows easier and more free skill
        adjustment as follows:

	* Custom -- easy

	  Five options points to improve skills, but it's possible to gain
          more. Skills can be improved two steps above their initial level,
          and degraded one step below their initial level. Degrading a skill
          below its' initial level gains you an extra option point.

	* Custom -- too easy

	  Five options points to improve skills, but it's possibile to gain
          more. Skills can be improved three steps above their initial level,
          and degraded two steps below their initial level. Degrading a skill
          below its' initial level gains you an extra option point.

        * The good old "Custom" method stays as our standard, traditional
          way to create a character with five options points to improve
          your skills. Plaint "Custom" method allows to improve skills one step
          above their initial level and doesn't support degrading the skills
          below their initial level.

 - balanced: item prices

	With the help of various historical sources and a few modern studies
        all the item prices have been checked and balanced. Item prices are now
        linked and relative to value of a squirrel hide, which is kind of a
        basic "currency". This "squirrel hide currency" stays a hidden factor,
        but gives us a historically accurate base for item pricing. 

	MIGRATION NOTICE: The items your character has obtained in the
        previous version are valued according to their old prices. You can
        expect some of your old metal weapons, armours and hides to appear
        less valuable than expected.

	Few notes about certain item types:

        * hides

          In general hides are more valuable than before. However, relative
          value between different types of hides hasn't changed dramatically.
          The most valuable furs of them all are those of lynx, bear, glutton
          and wolf. Of smaller animals, the most valued hides come from
          beaver, pine-marten, fox and polecat. 

	* fur clothes

          Fur clothes are slightly more valuable than before. 

        * metal weapons and armours

          In general many of the metal weapons are more valuable than before. 
          Especially the imported armours and weapons can be very, very
          valuable.

 - overhaul: quality tags

        All the items are now prone to quality tags. If there's no specific
        quality description displayed (eg. you see a plain "sword") the item
        in question is of average quality. There are five different levels of
        quality and the quality descriptions may vary among different
        item types.

        MIGRATION NOTICE: Some of your old items may now appear quality
        tagged even if their quality wasn't present in the previous version.
        This is because items have always had quality values, but only now
        they have come visible for the character.

 - added: varying quality items for NPCs

        NPC equipment is assessed based on the wealth of their culture.
        The more wealthy cultures have finer and better quality equipment.
        This applies to personal inventories of NPCs, and also to
        storehouses/community equipment. The more primitive and less wealthy
        cultures can nevertheless produce and possess fine crafts, but the
        amount and variety of "luxury" items is far greater among wealthy
        cultures.

 - added: character's starting equipment is assessed based on the wealth
          of their culture

        The more wealthy culture you belong to, the finer and better better
        quality equipment you start with. For example, a fresh driikilis
        character may possess masterwork weapons and fine clothes and armours.
        The more primitive and less wealthy cultures start with that much
        more rough equipment. However, the common weapons and tools
        are usually of at least decent quality for all the cultures.

 - modding add: [noquality] tag

	[noquality] tag can be used with diy-items to:
        a) ignore quality of the finished item 
        b) ignore quality of the raw material/item required

	If [noquality] is used in item header the finished item will always
        be of average quality. For example, in case of bandages there's no
        good reason to have them quality tagged. So our header goes like:
	.Bandage. 	*COMMON*   [noquality]   [patch:10]

	If [noquality] is used on {raw material/item} line the quality of
        tagged item doesn't affect to finished item quality. For example,
        if we don't want quality of a tree trunk to affect in our attempt
        to make a club:
	.Club. 			*COMMON*		/30/
	{Slender trunk} [remove] [noquality]
	{Cutting weapon} <Axe> 			

        Unless [noquality] is used, the finished item quality is based on
        calculations described in the news sections: 
	- "impact of raw material and tool quality/usefulness" 
	- "skill mastery level impact on produced item quality"
	In most cases varying diy-item quality is desirable - but not always.

 - added lots of plants

        Crowberry, mother pipe, bear pipe, dog pipe, wolf pipe, clayweed,
        bog bean, marsh calla, water lily, lake reed, milkweed, burdock
        and more.
	Some of the new plants carry their common english names - and some
        have "unreal worldish" names.

        With new plants comes some new features:

	* there are some true aquatic plants

	* it's possible to collect roots of some new plants

          To do this, you need to harvest them down and then tresh.

        Thanks for the plant graphics go to brian.shapiro.

 - added: possibility to collect young leaves from a sprout

	Plants that yield leaves can be harvested for young leaves as soon as
        the plant is somewhat grown. When such a plant is being picked you'll
        be asked if you wish to collect its leaves. Picking the leaves of a
        sprout will harm its growth, but this way you'll get to utilize the
        very first greens of the spring.

 - improved: flour making

	Agriculture option "grind" now accepts also certain roots and seeds to
        be ground for wild flour. 

 - added: HERBLORE-skill (and removed FORAGING-skill)

	Herblore is the ability to recognize individual plants and their 
        properties. The most common plants are known to everyone, but
        knowledge of the rest depends on your character's culture and his
        herblore skills.

	* Unknown plants are displayed in different, blurred color and have 
          vague randomized names. For example, if rye is unknown to your 
          character it may appear as "unknown cereal".

	* You may use herblore skill to recognize either growing plants, or 
          plants and their parts in your inventory. Upon using the skill you'll
          be shown a dialog displaying all the information you know about the
          plant in question.

        * You can learn plant properties by using them,	even if you wouldn't
          be able to recognize plant's indentity. If your character has
          learned plant properties by experience the effects are shown as
          your character has noticed them. Only when a plant's identity is
          recognized you'll gain information about the known effects in full.

	* Even if the plant has been recognized by sight and identity, it 
          doesn't mean you've learned all of it's properties. Learning the
          plant completely after its identity has been recognized sometimes
          calls for developing in herblore in general, and more experimenting.

        * MIGRATION NOTICE: 

          Herblore knowledge for a migrating characters is created from a
          scratch, according to their culture and base attributes. As a result,
          some of the plants your migrated character possesses may now appear
          unknown to him/her. They still are the very same plants with the
          same properties, but it may take a while to make your character
          learn it.

	* See HERBLORE game encyclopedia entry for more information.

 - added: possibility to use herbs also in dressing the wound

        Previously only cleaning the wound and applying a compress allowed
        usage of herbs. Now you can slip something soothing under the bandages
        as well.

 - overhaul: impact of raw material and tool quality/usefulness

	* raw material quality

	  Quality of raw materials used in crafting now affects to quality of
          finished item. Shortly, you can't make good out of bad. Basically the
          quality of finished item can't be higher than the average quality raw
          materials used. 

	* tool usefulness

  	  Some tools are more handy for certain tasks than the others. This is
          a good old, and clear game mechanism, and player is always informed
          when certain type of tool is preferred for the task.
          Usefulness of the tool foremostly affects to how long it will take to
          complete the task, but now it also affects to quality of crafted item.
          If an item is crafted with an unhandy tool the maximum possible 
          quality is degraded according to tool used. The more unhandy the tool,
          the less perfect the resulting item can be expected to be. 

          For example: you can't carve fine wooden bowls with a stone-axe any 
          more. However, with a good quality stone-axe you may still succeed 
          better than with one of average quality.
        
	* tool quality

          Tool quality affects foremostly to quality of resulting item, but also
          to time required to complete the task. You can't craft the finest and
          perfect items with poor quality tools. The system here is biased 
          towards degrading resulting item quality for using poor tools, rather
          than requiring superior quality tools for superior results. An 
          average axe in the hands of skilled craftsman is all he needs to make
          fine items. However, high quality tools can be important to substitute
          for disadvantages of unhandy tools. 

          For example: using a fine knife to craft a club may sometimes prove 
          better results than working with a crude stone-axe - even if an axe
          would be initially preferred for the job.

	All in all; tool quality and tool usefulness now play together in 
        complex and advanced manner making it important to use handy, 
        appropriate and good quality tools if you are after the best possible 
        results and efficient working pace. The player is now also informed
        not only about tool usefulness, but also about effects of its 
        quality, when crafting or other tool requiring jobs are started.

 - added: weapon quality affects to their impact 

	High quality weapons receive a slight bonus to their impact.
        Poor quality weapons have their impact slightly degraded.

 - improved: skill mastery level impact on produced item quality

	This is a fundamental addition which affects to all items that are 
	produced by using your character's skills; crafting, cooking, building
        and so on.

	Finished item quality is now assessed based on your crafting success 
	modified by your mastery level. From now on, novice craftsmen can 
        rarely produce top quality items and highly skilled craftsmen can trust
	that the skills they've achieved won't fail all too easily. Skill rolls
	are made normally, there can be failures and successes, but failures of
	a master craftsman may be superior to the successes of a novice.

	For example: a character with 30% mastery in CARPENTRY tries to craft a
	wooden shovel but succeeds only marginally. The resulting wooden shovel
	will be of poor quality. If a character with 85% mastery in CARPENTRY 
	tries to craft a wooden shovel and also succeeds only marginally the 
        resulting wooden shovel will be of decent quality - not fine but no 
	poor either.

	Moreover, complete novices can't produce top quality items no matter 
	what. They may be able to produce decent crafts, but only when there's
	enough mastery in the play the finished items will be of superior 
	quality. The odds to produce better quality items in more steady 
	fashion now grows in line with skill mastery levels.

 - improved: batch crafting - varying quality allowed

	Skill roll is now made separately for each item produced allowing
	finished items vary in quality. Most of the produced items will
        probably be of even quality matching your applicable skill level
	and performance - but it's possible to find some pleasant or 
        unpleasant surprises in the mix. 

	For example: if you make batch of 10 arrows you may obtain 5 decent 
        ones, 3 crude and 2 curved arrows as a result.

 - improved: batch cooking - varying quality allowed

	The rules and expected results are the same as in batch crafting.

 - added: smoking and drying decreases weight of the food prepared

	Drying decreases prepared food weight the most, but smoked food is also
        significantly lighter. This gives smoked and dried food a great 
        advantage for it's easier to carry, but still as nutritious as it ever 
        was.
        
 - changed: harvesting (stealing) village crops - not allowed anymore

	Living off the stolen crops is naturally still possible, but it makes
        the villagers angry. In addition, when practising any unallowed 
        behaviour in the village there will be a dialog to cancel your action 
        if someone tells you to stop. This will help you not to make villagers
        angry unintentionally.

 - balanced: base attributes of skills

        Attributes (strength, dexterity etc.) determining the base level of each
        skill have been checked and balanced. 

 - balanced: skill starting levels for all the cultures

	It is still so that some cultures tend to be more skilled, and some
        are average, and some are weaker. But the relative superiority/inferioty
        of certain cultures is balanced from what it used to be. There are no
        dramatic changes, but minor surprises can be expected.

 - updated: game encyclopedia entries for all the cultures

        A few new lines here and there.

 - added: moddable starting skill levels and base attributes 

	There's ini_skills.txt file which can be edited to change starting 
        levels for each of the cultures. Also the base attributes (strenght, 
        dexterity etc.) determining the skill base can be modded. 

 - added: customizable skill hotkeys

	Refer to ini_skills.txt to customize skill hotkeys.
    
 - re-arranged: skill hotkeys (ALT+skill key)

        Default hotkeys for using skills have been re-arranged. 

 - changed: key command to view skills screen - it's LOWER case [s] now

	It will probably take few moments to get accustomed to this,
        but a reminder is displayed upon pressing the old skills-key.

 - improved: skills-screen

	Skills-screen has been stylized for clearer outlook and easier
        tracking of skill development:

	* The bars displaying skill mastery are colored according to skill 
          level, ranging from red (low) to green (high).

	* In addition to bars and percentage values also a verbal description 
          of skill mastery is now displayed; novice, skilled, talented etc.

	* Natural aptitude to learn and develop a skill is also displayed. 
          This is an old factor which now becomes visible for the player. 
          Natural aptitude affects to pace of skill improvement and it is 
          determined by your character's physical and mental attributes that
          form the skill base level.

	* Initial skill mastery is displayed within the mastery level bar as a
	  shaded section. This shows the mastery level your character started 
          with and gives you an idea of long term development of your skills.

	  MIGRATION NOTICE: Initial skill mastery for migrated characters
          isn't functional but is set to your current skill levels when 
          the character is first loaded into this version. 

        * Skills that have improved during the present game day are marked. 
          This gives you an idea of short term development of your skills. 

 - added: STEALTH-skill

	You can hide and sneak as usual, but the fundamental change here is
        that sneaking is now linked to this proper and visible skill which can
        be improved over time. Mobility rate of a sneaking character is about 
        a half of his walking speed.

 - modding changes: flora files

	* flora file extension has been changed from ".urw" to ".txt".
 	  Old ".urw" extension still works, but for the sake of simplicity 
          lets take flora_*.txt naming as a standard.

        * new root usage related flora tags: [ROOT_SIZE] and [ROOT_USE]

          If [ROOT_SIZE] is specified for a plant that is other than
          [root] type it will yield also roots. Possible values:
          XS/S/M/L/XL

          [ROOT_USE] can have two values: "cooked" and/or "flour"

          "cooked" requires boiling of the root before it's pleasant to eat.
          "flour" indicates the root can be used for wild flour.

          For example: [ROOT_USE:cooked flour]
                       [ROOT_USE:flour]
          If root use isn't specified the root can be eaten raw.

        * new HERBLORE related flora tags: [HERB_KNOWN] and [HERB_COMMON] 

          These two are related to implementation of HERBLORE-skill.

 	  [HERB_KNOWN] tags the cultures that know the plant by default.

          [HERB_COMMON] tags the cultures for whom this plant is commonly 
                        known. These cultures get a bonus to recognize the 
                        herb/plant by default.

	  Tag values: all, eastern, western, northern, kau, kie, dri, 
                      isl...etc. culture abbreviations.

	  Examples:
	  [HERB_KNOWN:eastern] - eastern cultures know this herb/plant 
                                 by default.
	  [HERB_COMMON:kau kie] - this plant is common to Kaumolaiset and 
                                  Kiesseliset.

 - fixed: bugged fish price

	All the fish, raw or cooked, had the same price value regardless of 
        their type or weight. That's fixed now.

 - fixed: inventory crash upon dropping the last item
 
 - fixed: NPCs not healing from their injuries

	This was broken and NPCs never healed. Fixed now.

 - added: possibility to quit the game by clicking "close the window" button 
          (X'ing out)

        If a character is being played this is equivalent to [Q]uit command
        and confirmation to save the character will be asked.
        Otherwise X'ing out will close the game quickly.

 - fixed: animal unpacking exploits and annoyances

	It's now possible to unpack items from your pack animal in storehouses
        without craftsmen getting involved. Also, unpacking animals while
        standing on pile of items will now take into account only the items 
        that animal was carrying; this fixes the storehouse exploit and allows
        precise unpacking.

 - fixed: items getting removed from under the construction to be built even
          if the process was aborted

 - balanced: exhausted and penalized combatants

        Attacking a prone enemy is always advantageous for the attacker even
        if the attacker is suffering from serious physical penalty.

	If both combatants suffer from penalties exceeding their combat skills
        the more skilled is still advantageous.

 - fixed: 'Warfare' quest not completing if the Njerpez were finished with
          pets or companions. 

 - added: start menu option to show/hide registration license info

        This goes for those who make "let's play" videos and don't wish to
        display their registration name.

 - added: start menu option to enter your registration code again if you
          happen to mistype it

 - improved: displaying previous topic in game-info browser

        Title of the previous topic is shown along with backspace (back to
        previous topics) button information.
        For example: [<--] Back to "CULTURES"

 - added: new character portraits

        Three new male portraits and one new old female portrait.
        Some of the new pics replace the old ones so it's possible that your
        migrated character may also have changed his face in this version :/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.14 - stable
Released: Feb-28-2012
** Saved characters from the previous version are compatible with this
   version. **

c

 - fixed: dogs and companions occasionally not attacking enemies or giving up
          fighting

	This happened mostly when sight of the enemy was lost.

 - fixed: broken "banishing the evil water guardian" ritual

 - updated game-info entries (F1): DODGE and BLOCK

 - added: strike difficulty descriptions to aiming zone selection dialog
        
        When selecting aiming zone (body/head/arms/legs) you'll see verbal
        description if the strike to certain aiming zone is challenging,
        difficult or very difficult compared to aiming at the body.

 - added: aiming zone modifiers for missile attacks

	* Aiming at head, arms or legs of your target is more challenging and
          requires that much more accurate shot/throw to hit. Aiming zone
          modifiers are dependant on target size, so shooting a squirrel to
          its legs needs much more precision than landing an arrow at elk's
          head.

 - balanced: missile combat damage

	* Damage from marginal projectile strikes has been reasoned down.
	  Good hits are as deadly as always, but an arrow that only scratches
	  the target doesn't necessarily inflict serious wound at all.

	* Damage from thrown rocks, stones and other items that are not
	  proper throwing weapons has been decreased. 

 - balanced: deathblow damage

	Deathblow always results in maximum damage for the given weapon.
	Finishing big animals with a small weapon may still require several
	blows, but in general deathblows are now more deadly than before.

 - fixed: crash when moving mouse over [ESC]-button in the skills screen

 - added: success in hideworking affects to size of the resulting hide 

 - improved: animals reactions to various threats

 - missile combat balanced

        * Shooting/throwing a projectile that is not already wielded takes one
          extra turn.

          The enemy may reach you or the game escape out of sight while you
          load your bow or grope for your javelin. As it's sometimes crucial
          to perform the first shot/throw as quickly as possible, it's best
          to approach your target with an arrow (or other projectile) already
          wielded.

	* Using ranged weapons when engaged by enemies at close combat range
          is now awkward, slow and not necessarily possible at all.

          It always takes one extra turn to throw a weapon or shoot with a bow
          when you are engaged at melee combat range - even if you had the
          weapon/arrow wielded already. Your enemy gets to make their move
          while you prepare to throw/shoot and depending on their actions you
          may not be possible to complete the attack at all. It's not possible
          to complete your attack if you get hit or make a defense maneuver -
          unless you gain a tactical advantage from it. If your enemy uses his 
          turn for something that doesn't hamper your performance you can
          complete the throw/shot normally.

 - fixed: bugged animal icons on wilderness map

        This was mostly about forest reindeers appearing as cups. 

 - fixed: NPCs accepting spoiled meat in trading

 - balanced: firewood weight 

        Decreased from 2 lbs to 1.5 lbs.

 - balanced: arrow price 

	Arrows are now significantly more valuable.
	
 - balanced: animal prices

        Animal prices have been increased and linked to the amount of meat
        they provide.  Domestic animals now cost about three times their
        meat price, so you can't buy them with sticks and trinkets anymore.

 - added: arrow breakage

	Arrows may break from striking living targets or solid map tiles such
        as trees, walls, boulders etc. An arrow breakage from striking a solid
        tile is something you will notified about, but if an arrow breaks from
        striking a living target you'll notice it only by having less arrows
        to collect from a kill. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.14-b3 
Released: Jan-28-2012

(Scroll down for a complete newslist for version 3.14beta.)


- fixed: false weared item count in NPC information box 
         (eg. "He is wearing 4 fur footwears")

- balanced: skill improvement with target practice 

	* Target practice skill improvement rate has been decreased a bit.
        * Throwing/shooting at targets less than 5 tiles away isn't considered
          a proper target practice and doesn't improve your skills.

- fixed: container properties corrupting upon filling/pouring. 
         
	This bug caused pots to lose their cooking equipment status.

- balanced: animal sizes and meat weights

	* Big animals appear less frequently than average sized or small ones.
        * As a result of meat weight balancing you can now expect to get less 
          meat from big game animals than previously.

- fixed: animals eating a whole stack of food at once

- fixed: pets moving faster than player character 

         Which made it very hard to get your dog leashed.

- improved: NPC/animal escape routes 

        NPCs/animals can now change their course during the chase, make some 
        erratical turns and really try to lead their enemy astray. 
        (Be prepared to get fooled by an ordinary hare.)

- fixed & improved: withering of plants

        * Plants withering overnight has been fixed.
        * All the plants will now wither gradually within timespan
          of few weeks.
        * Withering plants will turn darker as the process goes on.

- added: more plant/agriculte information 

        * Upon looking at your crops you'll be told if the plant has
          started to wither and for how long you can expect it to live.
        * An estimated harvest time will be told upon looking at
          growing plants - or when trying to harvest them too early.
        * A proper planting time will be told if you try to plant/sow
          something too early.

 - improved: tracking

        Tracking mechanics are basically the same as before, but spotting
        and finding tracks is more closely linked to level of your 
        TRACKING-skill.
        You'll also need to use your TRACKING-skill more often to reveal
        the true path of your game as in many cases animals don't leave as 
        many automatically visible tracks as before. 

        * NPC/animal size and weight determines how clear and visible
          tracks it will leave. The stronger the tracks, the easier
          they are to spot even by an unexperienced tracker. The
          fainter the tracks, the greater TRACKING-skill is required
          to spot them.

        * You'll notice some tracks automatically, but sometimes
          detecting tracks calls for using your TRACKING-skill - see below.
          Whether you spot some tracks automatically or not depends
          on their visibility and level of your TRACKING-skill.

        * You can search for tracks by using your TRACKING-skill at location 
          where there are no visible tracks already. Your current location 
          and adjacent tiles will be examined and if you spot new tracks they 
          become visible and you'll be informed about the results. Searching
          for new tracks this way needs to be done only once per location - 
          repeating the procedure doesn't improve the results.

        * NPCs/animals will leave tracks most easily on moss and lichen
          covered terrain types. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.14-b2 | update for version 3.14beta 
Released: Jan-04-2012

Scroll down for a complete newslist for version 3.14beta.

- missile combat improved: vertical angle of the shot/throw and terrain
  elevation featured

	* Vertical angle of the shot/throw is now determined based on target
          height/elevation.

	  No more only upwards, maximum distance shots. 
          Shooting/throwing at a small, short or prone creature gives the
          missile downwards angle, so upon missing such a target the missile
          will hit the ground somewhere behind the target. However, the
          vertical shooting/throwing angle also depends on terrain elevation
          at your and target's location, so shooting and missing a fox on a
          hill may still send your arrow far, far away. And so forth. 

	* Possibility to aim at the ground

	  If selected target is neither an obstacle nor a creature the
          missile will be thrown/shot at the ground. So throwing baits at
          traps, branches into fire etc. now works as it should. 

	* Tracking of missile altitude and terrain elevation

	  Missile altitude is now tracked precisely and in relation to
          terrain elevation, so missiles can also hit and stop at the high
          ground. (It's good to have a high bank behind your archery target.)

- added: deathblow/butchering - special attack options

        Upon attacking an unconscious or a leashed creature a special 
        deathblow/butchering strike becomes possible. This allows you
        to make a carefully aimed strike at vital areas of your victim.
        This option is available only when you aren't engaged by any
        other hostile NPCs. The effects of a deathblow are:

        * Success of a melee attack is significantly higher when attacking 
          unconscious/leashed creatures.
        * Instead of choosing an aiming zone you'll get to choose one the 
          most "kill-proof" body locations; skull, neck, thorax or abdomen.

        After executing a deathblow the strike resolution will follow as 
        usual and the chosen weapon/aspect/location combination can still 
        produce various results. A deathblow with a little, rusty knife or 
        a rock is hardly enough to finish your enemy at once, so there's 
        room for a player to learn the proper butchering techniques for each
        case. It's recommended to first knock your farm animals unconscious 
        and only then use cutting weapons.

- fixed: thrown weapons appearing automatically wielded when picked up after a throw/shot
- fixed: non-existent frostbite treatment
- fixed: exploits to rest while swimming by doing various player activities (drink,wear,wield,take off etc.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.14beta
Released: Dec-22-2011

* Saved characters from the previous version are compatible with this version.

NOTICE: This is a beta version and there's still some work and polishing to do.
        However, we've got fairly stable and playable version here and no 
        show-stopping bugs have been found during test sessions. The development 
        towards final 3.14 release will continue after christmas holidays.

 - game-info browser (F1) improved

        * Fixed: Navigating with cursor keys.
        * Added: Justified lines.
        * Key-command for returning to previous topic is now [backspace]
          instead of previously used [cursor left]-key.

 - added new game-info entries:

        LIMB INJURIES, TACTICAL ADVANTAGE, COUNTERSTRIKE
        MISSILE COMBAT, RANGED TARGET

 - updated game-info entries:

        INJURIES, WOUND TREATMENT, BLEEDING WOUNDS

 - improved: character positioning upon zooming in

        Your last location on each zoomed-in map will be saved when you
        zoom out - and when zooming back in you will return at the exactly
        same location. Few exceptions to this rule are entering villages etc.
        and encountering animals/NPCs.

 - improved: wound treatment

        * Each wound can be now treated on a daily basic for as long as the
          injury persists. Each successfull treatment will improve the
          healing of an injury, but mistakes are also possible and can worsen
          the healing process. For serious wounds, however, some first-aid is
          always recommended over no treatment at all. After that, it's up
          for your consideration whether you think you can do better for a
          specific wound today, or should it be wiser not touch it at all.

        * Now there can be several different treatments available for a
          single injury of which you can choose the ones to use - or the ones
          possible for you at the moment.

        * For almost every treatment it's also possible to use healing herbs
          in the process.

 - modding add: editable game messages

        Some game messages now appear in editable text files which can be
        found in messages/ subfolder of your UrW installation. The syntax of
        game messages features usage various tags and variables which are
        also editable - so we're actually talking about flexible and moddable
        script language here.
        In the future all the game messages will be editable making it
        possible to compile your own storytelling styles and translations. 
        (A proper guide to message syntax is yet to be written.)

 - combat messages re-written

       All the combat messages have been rewritten and feature the new 
       editable message syntax. Combat messages are far more verbose and
       detailed than previously and now reveal all the combat sequence
       aspects that are tactically important or otherwise valuable in the
       given combat situation. The new, vivid and descriptive combat messages
       can also teach you a great deal of strengths and weaknesses of each
       combatant and their maneuvers.

 - combat overhaul (= a monumental task in a nutshell) 

	All the combat code has been rewritten from the scratch. The
        fundamental combat mechanics, maneuvers and sequence stay the same,
        but there are lots of improvements that make the combat more
        tactical, challenging and fun. Moreover, all the combat rules now
        work exactly the same for NPCs as they work for the player
        character. In addition to many minor improvements which stabilize
        and equalize combat mechanics there are also completely new
        features like:

	* added: counterstrike - a new defense maneuver

	  Counterstrike is a new defense maneuver where the defender attempts 
          to strike the attacker back instead of defending themselves from
          the attack. It is possible to use any of your wielded weapons to 
          counterstrike. Nearly always when an attack is answered by a
          counterstrike one or both of the combatants gets struck - and
          simultaneous strikes may occur as well. Animals can also make
          counterattacks, so an angry bear that constantly keeps attacking
          back at you may now appear to be significantly harder to bring
          down.

	* added: tactical advantage - a new, special result of a combat
                 round

          A character wins a tactical advantage when he causes an opponent to
          fall down, drop a weapon, or manages to exploit the opponent's poor
          combat performance - be it an attack or a defense. Upon gaining a
          tactical advantage a character may immediately make another extra
          action regardless of whose combat turn it is.
          For further information see TACTICAL ADVANTAGE game-info entry (F1).

        * added: attack and defense classification of weapons

          All the weapons have been given their unique attack and defense
          classes which determine how well a certain weapon will perform 
          on attack or defense. Moreover, the weapon class will also
          determine if your weapon happens to be advantageous against your
          opponent's weapon - or vice versa. The combatant whose weapon
          class is superior to their opponent during the given combat
          round (attack maneuver vs. defense maneuver) gets a bonus to the
          success of his action.
          Attack and defense performance of each weapon can be learned by 
          examining a weapon from character's inventory [i], but a proper 
          combat message is also displayed when somebody gains a weapon class 
          bonus.
          For further information see WEAPON CLASS game-info entry (F1)

        * added: results of limb injuries

      	  Limb injuries now degrade the victim's physical performance in a
          very prominent way as they immediately affect the usability of the
          hurt limb. Leg injuries affect the victim's ability to walk, run or
          stand up. If an entire leg becomes unusable the victim either falls
          prone or starts to limp seriously. Quadruped animals can stand up
          and walk as long as they have three usable legs, but the mobility
          of a limping animal is significantly lowered. For humans, an
          unnusable legs means not being able to stand up and being able to
          move only by crawling. When an arm is injured to the extent of
          becoming unusable, any items held by it are dropped and wielding or
          handling items becomes impossible.

 - missile combat overhaul (= a monumental task in a nutshell)

        All the code related to throwing/shooting projectiles has been
        rewritten from the scratch. The most fundamental improvement here is
        that the trajectory for thrown/shot items is now calculated and
        generated in physically accurate and realistic manner. This chances
        pretty much the whole nature of missile combat.

        * The distance how far an item will fly is based on the initial
          velocity, angle of the shot/throw and air resistance of the item.
          The velocity at which an arrow is shot depends solely on the bow.
          When an item is thrown by hand the initial velocity is based
          foremostly on item weight and aerodynamic qualities, but also on
          character's strength or applicable weapon skill. Needless to say,
          throwing weapons are still the most optimal items to be thrown by
          hand.
         
	* "Out of range"-restriction removed

          It's now possible to try to throw/shoot an item to a location that 
          is "out of range". In that case the item simply doesn't fly that
          far, but it doesn't stop you from trying.

        * Flying items are checked for a possible hit at each map location on
          their trajectory

          This is crucial to understand to avoid foolish mistakes in new
          missile combat system! Due to trajectory based hit checks it's
          possible to hit also something else than your original target. This
          makes it easier to score a hit when shooting/throwing at tight
          flock of game animals - or a group of enemies. On the other hand,
          it's more risky to take a shot/throw at a target near your own party
          member or a pet.

        * Success of the shot/throw

          Upon shooting/throwing you'll get to choose a target, just like
          before, and then the applicable (weapon) skill is checked to
          determine the success of your shot/throw. The success (or failure)
          at an instant of the shot/throw determines how much your aiming is
          off, ie., how wide cone of spread is possible for the thrown/shot
          missile. An effective missile trajectory is then calculated
          according to the given cone of spread and intented target. The
          better the shot, the smaller the cone of spread - and your missile
          is more likely to travel where you aimed at. And naturally, even
          a failed shot/throw is bound to hit better at close range. If the
          missile arrives at location of a living target more checks are made
          to see if it actually strikes the victim; angle of incidence,
          target size and its movement may either save it from getting hit
          or to degrade the impact.

	* Graphical display of thrown/shot projectiles

          You'll see the item symbol travelling through the screen following
          its exact trajectory.

        * Moving targets feature a new, automated "defense" mechanism against 
          missile attacks

          A target that is being attacked by a missile weapon can't choose
          any conscious defense maneuver, but moving targets can still avoid
          getting hit. This defense possibility for moving targets is
          automated and it doesn't matter if the target is aware of the
          attack or not. The faster the target is moving the better chance it
          has to make it out of the way or to make a lucky movement in its
          place and unintentionally dodge the missile. This is based on the
          target's actual mobility and manner of moving, so if the target is
          slowed down due to physical penalties or for whatever reason, its
          chances to avoid missile attacks are lowered accordingly. 
          As this applies also to player character, your best defense against
          overpowering enemy bowmen from now on is just to run - and faster 
          you run the more safe you are. 

        * For further information see MISSILE COMBAT game-info entry (F1)

 - added: possibility to practice missile combat skills
                
        Throwing projectiles and shooting arrows at non-living targets can be
        used to test and improve the according weapon skill. Improving your
        skills by target practice is relatively slow, but possible.
        Moreover, target practice is useful to give you a realistic idea of
        your archery/throwing skills as you can see how frequently you can
        hit a target at this or that range. 

 - added: detailed injuries and body locations for NPCs

        * All the injuries for NPCs are now generated and tracked in the same
          detail as for the player character.
        * Body parts of animals are now named respectively to their anatomy,
          so there can be wounds like: serious cut in left paw, minor
          puncture in right hindleg and a crush in left wing.
        * Looking at NPC (F3) displays a detailed list of all the injuries,
          including the exact body locations.
        * NPCs can suffer from new additional effects that may result from
          certain injury/body location combinations, e.g. limb injuries.
        * The effects and mechanics of being injured are exactly the same
          for NPCs and the player character.

 - added: NPC information window

        When looking at NPCs (F3) their general information, carried items,
        wounds etc. are now displayed in a separate window, rather than in
        general message area.
       	
 - changed: mobility formula and indicator

	* A formula to calculate character's mobility has been changed. The
          mobility will be decreased due to physical penalties as usual, but
          the curve is smoother.
	* Mobility indicator now displays your movement rate in kilometers
          per hour (km/h). The indicator is also located differently, now
          appearing at the bottom of the "walking/running/etc."-display.
        * game-info entry for MOBILITY has been updated

 - balanced: animal prices

        All the animals you can purchase from the villages now appear
        slightly more valuable.

 - added: species specific fatigue rates for animals

        Fatigue accumulation has the same effect on animals as it has on
        humans; decreasing mobility and degrading physical performance. With
        species specific fatigue rates in effect certain animals will now
        tire up faster than the others. This allows a remote possibility to
        actually run down an extremely fatigued, escaping animal. However,
        such a hunt calls for an easy terrain and not allowing your prey to
        rest during the chase.

 - fixed: NPCs with tilted heads 

	NPCs didn't look exactly the same direction they were facing. Having
        their "heads tilted" an NPC facing to east was actually looking to
        north-east, and so on.

 - fixed: game freezing potential upon loading certain maps

 - fixed: heavy CPU utilization from idle animation

 - fixed: items disappearing from zoomed-in maps

        This bug manifested itself after travelling on zoomed-in maps with
        lots of animal or NPC activity and items. As this was the last found
        and now fixed occurence of item disappearing issues, it's now more
        safe than ever to leave your precious belongings at your campsite.

 - fixed: picked mushrooms spawning again overnight

 - fixed: pets always walking with full speed

        It was especially difficult to catch your pet dogs when they were
        loose from a leash. Now pets try to follow your character's walking
        pace unless there's special reason to rush ahead.

 - fixed: exploit to improve TRACKING by continuous skill usage at the same
          location

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.13-patch 4
Released: Jun-16-2011

* Saved characters from the previous version are compatible with this version.

 - updated game-info entries: NUTRITION, STARVATION, PHYSICAL PENALTIES

 - fixed: armour screen "wall of orange"-bug 

 - fixed: game-info browser generating multiple (excess) links

	If the same keyword was found multiple times within a certain page 
	it was also highlighted (as a link) multiple times. Now each keyword
        is highlighted only once, which improves readability a great deal.
      
 - modding fix: \time\ header value issues when using "days to prepare"-
                abbreviation (\???d\)

 - fixed: "buying animals for free"-exploit

 - fixed: "permanent injury"-bug

        Sometimes your overall injury just wouldn't decrease even after
        all your wounds had healed.
                                       
 - fixed: skill-screen delay on Window 7/Vista

 - fixed: pets/companions blocking your movement especially in small
	  houses

        Now it's possible to move into same location where your pet/companion
        is. If there's free space around, your pet/companion will move to an
        adjacent tile. If not, you'll simply share the tile.

 - fixed: reporting of multiple identical items at the same location

	All the individual items and item stacks are now reported correctly 
        when examining a location. Previously this didn't happen if there
        were a series of identical item names to report.

 - fixed: nutritional values of meat prepared prior to version 3.13

        All kind of meat prepared prior to version 3.13 suffered from
        bugged nutritional values making it very low on energy content.
        If your old character has still got some ancient meat in his
        cellar it can be happily consumed now as it's nutritious and
        proper food again.

 - changed: drinking and stomach content

        Drinking doesn't automatically fill your stomach anymore unless
        your thirst is completely extinguished first. This removes the
        confusing case where your stomach would get accidentally filled
        when you only tried to quench your thirst.
        Notice that drinks and beverages with energy and nutrient content
        (milk for example) can be still seen to lower the feeling of
        hunger as your energy reserve is increased.

 - balanced: initial nutrition level of a new character has been increased

 - balanced: starvation

        Starvation is now checked during the day on hourly basis and
        grows slower than previously. You'll be clearly notified when
        gaining physical penalty from having starved. The same goes
        for recovering from starvation.

 - added: nutrition meter

        In addition to good old (and misleading) "Hunger" meter there's
        now also "Nutrition" meter. As the "Hunger" meter deals with
        only the FEELING of hunger the "Nutrition" meter was added to
        show you also the character's energy/nutritional reserve - which
        is maybe even more important factor to know in order to keep
        yourself properly fed.
           "Nutrition" meter displays self-explanatory verbal
        descriptions of your character's energy/nutrition reserve. The
        scale goes from "starving", "malnourished" and "scarce" all the
        way to "good", "well-fed" and "abundant".

 - improved: hunger and thirst meters

	The bars of both meters now change their color depending on the
        long-term level of hunger or thirst. The bars start to grow in 
        familiar green shade but will gradually turn into red when the 
        level of alarming malnutrition or dehydration is reached. As the 
        both hunger and thirst meters can have maxed out bars with the 
        condition still growing, the color of the bar now tells you how 
        the things are developing.

 - balanced: thirst and dying of thirst

	* Thirst accumulation during the sleep has been justly decreased.

	* Level of lethal dehydration has been increased. 
          So it's possible to survive a little longer without water, but 
          that's something you still shouldn't try on purpose.

	* There are new messages describing the level of thirst present.
          Just like before you'll be told when you are very thirsty, but
          you'll also be told when it's turning deadly.

 - corrected: nutritional values of broad beans, peas and turnips

        All of these have gained a little nutritional boost. In case of 
        broad beans the energy content was quite too low and the increase 
        is significant.

 - fixed: keypad period '.' not working on AZERTY-keyboards

 - fixed: hunger and thirst levels reverting upon cancelling certain
          tasks

 - fixed: material usage miscalculations with item stacks and weight based
          crafting/cookery requirements

        If there was more than enough raw material in the selected item
        stack, you could loose an extra item after completing the material
        selection dialog.


This is a list of new features in the current and previous versions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.13-patch 3
Released: Mar-18-2011

* Saved characters from the previous version are compatible with this version.

Newslist for 3.13-patch3 starts here:
(read on to reach the actual 3.13 newslist)

 - added: verbose notifications about character's physical condition when
          certain physical performances would be degraded (or impossible)
          due to physical penalties

        Currently physical condition notifications are displayed only for
        swimming, moving or running. And only when there's something to
        report. 

 - modding add: possibility to [name] diy items + added [naming] tag for even
                more customized naming 
                
        [name] tag can be now used not only for cookery recipes, but for *.diy
        items as well. There's now also an additional [naming] tag which
        modifies the value of %s used by [name] tag.

        [naming] tag can have two values:

        [naming:last word] - %s will get value of the last word of selected
                             material/item name 
        [naming:original]  - %s will get value of original and complete
                             selected material/item name

        If neither is used [name] simply tries to generate parent object
        string automatically, but most often fails if it's not about cookery.

        Few examples:
        -------------
        {* leggings} [name:Modded %s] [naming:last word]

        ...will produce an item called "Modded leggings".

        {* leggings} [name:Modded %s] [naming:original]

        ...if the selected item was for example leather leggings,
        the result will be "Modded leather leggings".

        {Leather *} [name:Modded %s] [naming:last word]

        ...if the selected item was for example leather shirt,
        the result will be "Modded shirt".

        etc.

 - added a new plant: heather 

 - added: flowering plants

        Most of the wild herbs do flower now respective to their own special
        flowering periods. For starters this is mostly an eye candy addition
        as herbal effects of the plants are the same whether you use leaves
        or flowers. (In the future the herbal effects may vary depending on
        the used parts.)
        The difference between growing, flowering and "past the flowering
        season" plant is graphically represented, but there's also a verbal
        description available upon looking at the plant. If the plants is a
        flowering kind it's possible to gather its' seeds only after the
        flowering period is over. 

 - improved: hunger and body energy reserve system

        Feeling of being hungry (or satiated) is now based on stomach content,
        energy intake and body energy reserve. Upon loading your old character
        for the first time into this new system you'll get to start with full
        stomach.
          The new system is much more detailed and realistic than before, but
        easily comprehended by using your common sense and trying different
        kind of diets.
          As stomach content factor is completely new, at first it seems to
        restrict one's ability to eat as much as before AT ONCE. On the other
        hand the equal amount of nearly any food will fill your stomach
        equally. So berries, single vegetables etc. are now proper food and
        effective snacks. But as we have learned, there are differences
        between nutritional values of different kind of foods. So eating it's
        not only about filling your stomach. Nutritional value of the food
        eaten affects the energy intake and increase of body energy reserve
        and these factors determine for how long you will feel satiated
        and have enough energy in your system.
          It is even possible to increase character's body energy reserve
        beyond the daily consumption by constantly eating high energy foods.
        After practicing this kind of diet you find yourself being not too
        hungry the day after. On the other hand, when practising very light
        diet the body energy reserve starts to drop which will backfire by
        frequent feeling of hunger. Very poor diet eventually leads to
        starvation. When starving or having very low energy reserve one finds
        himself getting hungry very fast and needs to eat quite often to
        recover from the condition.
          And so on...

 - improved: SWIMMING

        Swimming is no longer based continuously rolling dice for whether you
        sink or advance but on growing fatigue during the procedure and your
        SWIMMING mastery level which determines how fast you will lose your
        strength to keep afloat. The more skilled swimmer you are the slower
        the fatigue will accumulate, and longer you can swim before getting
        over exhausted. However, rivers and rapids are more strenuous to cross
        even for a skilled swimmer.
           The distance a character can swim is now less random and always
        quite the same for the same skill level. Naturally all the physical
        penalties and fatigue to start with do lower the performance. 
            When accumulated fatigue is starting approach  the character's
        SWIMMING mastery level, he is in fear of drowning. Warnings and remarks
        about the swimming progress will be displayed upon entering the water
        and during every swimming move so you won't drown by surprise. With
        very low swimming skill it's still advisable only to dip quickly into
        shallow water before you learn how long you can swim properly.
            The rate of swimming skill increase has been also lowered, so you
        won't no longer become master of swimming overnight.

 - fixed: any container working as a cooking pot

        Naturally this shouldn't be and has been fixed now.

 - fixed: fish recipes producing incorrect meal names

        This was the case at least with fish soup. 
       
 - fixed: "edible containers"-bug

 - fixed: armour analysis crash on some platforms

 - fixed: character misplacement after saving the game while in the water

        Characters saved in the water, nearby the shore, sometimes appeared
        on the ground leaving the watercraft in the water. This has been
        fixed now.

 - modified: game course selection is now allowed for "quick and easy"
             character generation mode

 - fixed: crashing when trying to build north-western wall of a kota
          too far from the framework

 - fixed: being able to consume plain flour
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.13-patch 2
Released: Jan-31-2011

* Saved characters from the previous version are compatible with this
* version.

Newslist for 3.13-patch2 starts here:
(read on to reach the actual 3.13 newslist)

 - modding fix: [ground] tag being ignored if there was no [remove] tag
                as well

                So now it's possible to use [ground] tag on it's own to
                check for required, not removable items on the ground.

 - fixed: planting seeds from a container using the whole contents at once

 - modding add: [TERRAIN:terrain_type] tag can be used as {requirement}
                in diy/biy_*.txt files.

                Example entry:
                -----------------------------------------------------------
                {[TERRAIN:spruce_mire pine_mire]} 'Mire terrain type'

                Notice the usage of both curly and square brackets and
                also DO use your own defined 'requirement description'.
                Multiple terrain types can be given. See TERRAIN-tags
                in flora_*.urw files to get the idea of possible
                terrain type name.

 - modding add: {requirement} entry is now wildcard sensitive.
                This instantly brings in various possibilities to
                come up with new, not too restricted item/material
                groups.

                Example entry = Allowed based on wildcard string comparison
                -----------------------------------------------------------
                {*bow}        = shortbow, juniper bow, long bow
                {*mail*}      = mail habergeon, short mail cowl.
                {Dried * cut} = Dried squirrel cut, dried badger cut

                If you do use wildcards in your {requirement} entries
                remember also to define your own requirement description
                as the default game output in the crafting requirements
                screen is exactly what's between the curly brackets { } 

                Example:
                -----------------------------------------------------------
                {*bow}        'A bow'
                {Dried * cut} 'Dried meat'

 - modding add: \time\ header value is now enabled for craftable (diy_*.*)
                items. There are also two new abbreviations which can be used
                to define the preparation time not only in minutes (which
                is the default) but also in hours or days:
                d - for days, and h - for hours.

                So, instead of \180\ you can use \3h\
                and instead of \1440\ you can use \1d\

                As a related issue, in-game time report for the items
                being prepared is also fixed.

 - fixed: plants disappearing instantly after their growing season is
          over

        Now all the plants, both wild and cultivated, start to wither
        gradually and individually after their growing season is over.
        This period lasts for several weeks so you'll surely notice
        when you should harvest your crops at the latest. The withered
        plants also stay visible for some time and only then disappear
        gradually - to sprout again in the spring. This also gives you
        more concrete feeling of the autumn as you one day notice the
        first withered berry shrubs and mushrooms.

 - fixed: game-info not being displayed in crafting menus for the items
          that can be made in patches

 - fixed: items on the ground disappearing upon entering/leaving certain
          zoomed-in maps

        This bug was related to densely populated or utilized maps and
        was a result of bad attempt to allocate more item space. The bug
        manifested itself usually by wiping out nearly all the vegetation
        from said map, or by losing (transportable) items upon zooming in.

 - fixed: crash potential upon encountering creatures on the wilderness map

 - fixed: village marker color glitch when viewing the map of known areas
          within a njerpez settlement

 - fixed: nutritional value of milk (which was completely missing!)

-- The actual newlist for version 3.13 starts here: --

 - added: modding possibilities

        This is the first version to feature moddable game data. The system
        is still far from complete and will grow more deep and more diverse
        step-by-step, but this is a start which brings in some great 
        possibilities already.
	  Currently it's mossible to mod plants, do-it-yourself items, 
        build-it-yourself constructions and cookery recipes. A modding guide
        will follow, but while waiting for that a spontaneous exploration of
        modding possibilities can be started from these files:

	  diy_*.*              - do-it-yourself items
	  biy_*.*              - build-it-yourself constructions
	  flora_*.*            - plants
	  cookery_*.*          - cookery recipes

 - flora of the UnReal World improved in many ways

        All of the plants have been checked and corrected for their 
        nutrional values, habitat, growing season etc. etc. etc. In general 
        the vegetable kingdom now appears in more rich and more realistic 
        detail on every field there is. There is a whole new secret life of 
        plants which is far too versatile to be described here, but luckily 
        can be learned by living in the unreal world.

        * In addition to harvesting plants only for berries, pods or root
          vegetables (like previously) it's now possible to harvest plants 
          for their leaves and seeds as well.

        * Added numerous medicinal effects for plants

          There are numerous effects. For example:

          astringent, anti-inflammatory, vulnerary, tonic, diaphoretic,
          alterative, pectoral etc. etc. etc.

          For some plants (like good old mushrooms) the effects take place
          when the plant is eaten, but usually it's necessary to prepare a
          herbal beverage from the leaves of a plant.

        * Added new cultivated plants:

          - Rye, Barley and Hemp

        * Added new wild plants:

          - Yarrow, Nettle, Sorrel, Meadsweet, Golden rod

 - added: destroying cultural settlements and/or population will also remove
          the settlement icon and cultural indication

        * Wiping out the whole population of a cultural settlement (village,
          camp etc.) will remove the cultural indicator of the neighbouring
          area turning it into no-man's land - except if the area consists 
          of clustered villages, it will belong to the original culture as 
          long as there are inhabitants in any of the closely neighbouring
          settlements.

        * Destroying any settlement completely (usually by burning) will 
          also remove the according settlement icon from the map view. This 
          applies to all types of settlements including Njerpez war-camps. 

        * When Njerpez do set up their war-camps, the neighbouring area will
          also turn into Njerpez territory.

 - added new character generation option: "Quick and easy"

        This option serves mostly the beginners, but also anyone who wants
        to get playing fast. Only thing you need to select here is the name of
        your character - all the rest of the character generation options 
        are randomized to a good average.

        Creating a character in the good old step-by-step fashion is now
        known as "Custom"-character generation.

 - changes in terrain type names

        All the bog and swamp terrain types are now called 'mires' which is 
        a more proper word for them as northern wetland areas.
        
        'Backwoods' terrain type is now called 'Spruce mire' as this terrain 
        type isn't a mere forest but a wetland area as well.

 - improved: remote target selection (F3)

        When selecting a remote target (to examine, throw, shoot etc.) the 
        cursor will appear initially at the location of your latest selection.
        The initial location is reset upon moving your character.

 - added water content for edible items

        Eating something that contains water reduces not only hunger but 
        thirst also. Of the raw ingredients the water content is naturally 
        highest in berries, but this new factor also applies to cookery 
        recipes. If there's additional water in the recipe (soups for 
        example) the water content will be effective in the resulting meal 
        as well.

 - added two new extended commands (#): Empty and Pour

        Both of these are related to containers; mugs, cup, bowls, pots,
        bags etc.

        * "Empty"-command

          Empties the container discarding the contents permanently.

        * "Pour"-command

          This is used to pour something from your inventory into a 
          container. The command can be used to pour from one container into 
          a another or to fill a container with selected (food) items. 
          Currently only foodstuff and liquid can be poured into a container
          making it's possible to carry and manage bags of roasted salmon
          and bowls of berries and so on.
          
        NOTICE: As result of improved container handling the containers 
                filled in the previous version may appear to be flagged as 
                empty - even though having titles like 'Pot of water' etc. 
                To reset and to return usability of such containers try 
                emptying them or re-filling them with water.

 - removed option: fill container with rainwater

        This will be introduced again in the future in a more realistic 
        fashion.

 - added three new AGRICULTURE options: Harvest, Tresh and Grind

        * Harvest-option is used to cut down or gather plants as a whole for 
          threshing. It is still possible to gather edible or mainly used part 
          of any plant by using the pick up-command (, or ;) but grains must
          be harvested via the actual harvest option. In addition, this is 
          the only way to collect the seeds from a plant.  
          The harvested crops must then be threshed.

        * Threshing is an act of separating the usable parts from the rest 
          of the harvested plant. It is most often done with grains to 
          separate the grain itself from the straw, but can be done with any
          plant. When threshing is complete the separated grain, seeds, 
          roots, leaves etc. may be collected.

        * Grinding is used to produce flour from grains. 

 - AGRICULTURE game-info updated

 - COOKERY overhaul

        Several additions have been made:

        * COOKERY-menu has been re-arranged. Available menu options now
          include the basic cooking and preservation methods (Roast, Boil,
          Salt, Dry, Smoke) which can be applied to practically any raw
          ingredients you like, and sub-categories for various recipes.

        * Lots of new recipes.

        * Preparing meals has become more open-ended as there's more variety
          and more freedom when it comes to choosing the ingredients. There
          are also optional ingredients in many recipes, so the possible
          variations to prepare even the most basic soup are numerous.

        * Nutritional values of prepared meals aren't predefined anymore,
          but based on the chosen ingredients and the cooking method used.
          This makes cooking far more interesting and worth of experimenting.
          A portion of meat stew doesn't always keep you satisfied for the
          exact same amount of time; it depends on what do you put in there.

        * ...and to accomplish all this: nutritional values of all the fish,
          animals and plants in the game have been checked and corrected.
          The system is now based on carbohydrate, protein and fat content
          in each and every foodstuff. 
	  
	  NOTICE: As a result nutritional value overhaul the food prepared 
                  in the previous version may appear less satisfying than 
                  expected. 

 - COOKERY game-info updated

 - added new skill: TRAPPING

        The name here is pretty self-explanatory. Trapping covers crafting
        and constructing various traps and setting them in place properly.
        For characters from previous version TRAPPING is opened upon first
        load with mastery level of one's TRACKING skill.
           TRAPPING-options can be accessed by using the skill directly,
        or from the [M]ake-menu just like before.

 - added new skill: CARPENTRY

        Introducing CARPENTRY also replaces the semi-useless WOODCARVING
        skill and for characters from the previous versions not only the
        names of these skills but also their mastery levels are swapped.
        Having the carpentry present now doesn't bring in anything too
        revolutionary, but separates craftable wooden handicrafts into their
        own section and under their own mastery level.
           Using the CARPENTRY-skill brings up a menu from where you can
        choose all the carpentry based crafts to make. All the carpentry
        based crafts can be also accessed from [M]ake-menu.

 - added new craftable items

        * Wooden shovel

          Can be used like any shovel, but the actual digging takes a bit
          longer than with its' metal counterpart.

        * Grainflail

          Grainflail is an important threshing implement.

        * Primitive bow

          A shortbow in the current version is a lot more demanding to craft
          than previously, so a primitive bow now takes its' place as a
          simple bow made from a slender tree trunk.

 - added new skill: BUILDING

        Building is the ability to construct forms of shelters and housing. 
        This ranges from durable wooden structures and kotas to simple
        shelters and fences. For characters from the previous version
        BUILDING-skill will be initialized to the mastery level of one's
        TIMBERCRAFT-skill.
           Using the BUILDING-skill brings up a menu from where you can
        choose the available constructions. The same building options can
        be accessed also from [M]ake-menu just like before.

 - added new construction to build: a kota
 
        Kota is built by using your BUILDING-skill. You can choose the size 
        of your kota freely within a certain range. Several slender tree 
        trunks and large animal pelts are required in the process.

 - changed building option: "Shutter" -> "Wall with a shutter"

        In the previous version a shutter could be cut into any built
        section of a wall. Now the wall and the shutter are built together.
        The result is the same, but now you need first to decide at which
        wall you wish to have a shutter and only then start to build it.

 - Crafting items re-arranged

        Regardless of the new features below, remember that the good old
        [M]ake items-menu still works and can be used as an overall menu
        for all the crafting and building there is.

        * As we now have a bunch of new skills all the craftable items have 
          been re-grouped under the according skills. As a result of this 
          using a certain skill (CARPENTRY, BUILDING, TRAPPING) allows you 
          to directly start crafting and building things belonging under 
          said skill. The same crafts can be naturally accessed through the 
          [M]ake-menu where they are just grouped a bit differently -
          by their usage.
          It's a matter of taste whether you wish to use the according skill
          directly to craft a certain item, or use the [M]ake-menu.

        * Item groups of [M]ake-menu have been slightly re-arranged and 
          there are new groups as well. With the self-explanatory group 
          names and using craft skills directly it shouldn't take too long 
          to learn what craft can be found from where in this version.
        
 - hideworking improved

        * Tanning hides is now a lot more laborous task including several
          steps from cleaning and soaking the skin, to applying tanning
          material, rinsing and finally mechanically softening the skin.
          It can now easily take couple of days to tan a big hide.
          Requirements for tanning process have also grown more complex
          including for example need of a working bench (table, bench or
          even a tree trunk will do) and a beater - which can be any
          club-like object used to pound the skin soft.

        * There are two new hideworking options:

          - Clean 

            Cleaning the fresh skin is now always the first thing to do
            before it can be processed any further, tanned or cured.

          - De-hair

            Dehairing is used (at will) to remove hair from the skin of a
            fur-bearing animal. This way the tanning always results in
            obtaining leather, which one may sometimes prefer.

        * Hideworking game-info has been updated to cover all the new
          aspects of hideworking process. There's also help button (?)
          added into hideworking menu to easily bring up the information
          when the hideworking time is at hand.

 - added: option to repair worn-out clothes

        Clothes and armours made from fur or leather can be now repaired by
        player. The option to do this can be found from clothes-section of
        [M]ake menu.
        If the piece of clothing to be repaired hasn't been damaged more
        than 40% of its' original size a corresponding amount of
        fur or leather is required and used to patch it up.

 - fixed: 'A house' advanced game-course task not completing if the house
          under construction had its' door left open.

 - fixed: Human NPCs practically never trying to dodge nor block if
          attacked

        This bug was propably easily unnoticed by many as it worked for the
        players favour, so expect the combat to be slightly more difficult
        now.

 - fixed: aggressive companions/dogs sometimes attacking random target
          upon zooming out from the battlefield

 - fixed (once more): ghost sounds of tree felling down

 - fixed: task triggering problems with "Prey in a trap" and
          "Checking the trap" tasks

 - fixed: sleeping NPCs (mostly animals) occasionally not waking up when
          attacked - and sometimes not even when seriously injured
         
 - fixed: squirrels staying 'up in a tree' even if the tree was felled down

 - added restriction to work the soil (using a shovel) on certain terrain
   types

        The soil of bog and swamp areas is just plain too wet to be
        worked for agricultural purposes or for digging pits.

 - added more birds: swan, tufted duck, mallard and capercaillie

        The first three are migratory aquatic birds being present from 
        spring to late autumn. All of the birds (including the good old 
        black grouse) now exist only at their typical habitat and do have 
        a bit more improved behaviour. Swans and mallards prefer bigger 
        lakes, tufted ducks are most happy at small marshland ponds and 
        capercaillies live in the vast conifer forests.

 - added: aquatic life for beavers

        Beavers now spend most of their time in the water, only occasionally
        coming to shore.

 - animal habitats checked

        Don't be surprised not to find too much wildlife at open mires 
        anymore as most of the animals now tend to live and exist only
        at terrain types which are their natural habitat.

 - added: outnumbering penalty 

        If the player is engaged by two or more enemies in a combat 
        situation each enemy above one will bring extra -10% penalty for 
        player's attack or defend maneuvers. It's not likely anymore for 
        even the most skilled swordsman to bring down eight Njerpez warriors
        surrounding him, as the mastery levels for attacking and defending
        in that case would suffer from -70% penalty.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.12
Released: May-26th-2010

* Saved characters from the previous versions generated prior to 3.12b are
* compatible with this version, but the world they lived in will be lost.
* See THE MIGRATION section before hurrying ahead with your old adventurer.

[The latest additions - START]
------------------------------

 - fixed: ghost notes and sounds of "Tree falls down."

        Couple of instances where the bug occured were found and fixed.
        Report back if more issues of this bug are encountered.

 - fixed: some (very clumsy = low agility) NPCs not being able to climb
          up even the lowest level elevations

 - fixed: trees felled by your companions sometimes producing bunch of
          slender tree trunks, instead of one tree trunk (which is how
          it should have been)

 - fixed: "bad tool penalty" wasn't applied when making wooden cups and
          bowls with stone-axe

 - improved: character location upon wilderness map encounters

        As we know, the character's location on the zoomed-in map relative
        to an encountered creature normally produces encounters where the
        creature is within the character's field of vision. This is still
        true in most cases, but there's now a minimum zoomed-in distance in
        effect which tends to locate the character further away, but still
        within sight of the prey. In addition to this, in cases where you
        can't see very far (nighttime etc.) the heading direction of the
        character and a verbal notification is your only lead to the
        whereabouts of the encountered creature, no visual guaranteed. This
        "heading and a hunch" based zoomed-in location is applied also to
        encountering creatures which aren't caught by surprise - and that
        would be mostly the ones you've encountered several times before or
        spotted from a greater distance. All of this was applied to add more
        challenge for hunting as it was all too easy if you just spot animals 
        on the wilderness map(especially around swamps), moved to
        encounter them and upon zoomed-in location your prey was within
        convenient range already.
        Now most of the real hunting has to be done on the zoomed-in map.

 - fixed: game freezing bug upon nocturnal encounters 

	The game could end up in a very long and slow loop when there was 
        a wilderness encounter during time of the day when character's range
        of sight was low.

 - fixed: bugged character body temperature calculations causing frostbites
          occasionally occur in seemingly random fashion, even in warm
          temperatures

 - balanced: bleeding injuries

        Several corrections have been made and the new bleeding mechanics
        will work exactly the same for NPCs and the player characer.

        * It will take a lot more time for the victim to faint (and
          eventually die) from bloodloss than previously.
        * Total number of bleeding injuries (and their severity) is naturally
          the main factor in how fast a fatal amount of blood will be lost.
          And an attribute which defines what's fatal is the character's
          (or NPCs) endurance. Higher the endurance the more one can bleed
          without ill effects.
        * A new feature for NPCs is that they can try to stop their wounds
          from bleeding, just like the player character. In case of animals,
          not too serious bleeding can (depending on endurance) even stop
          unaided.
        * So it's not determinate at all that your prey or enemy will perish
          if you manage to make it bleed - unless you make it bleed properly.
          If an animal is wounded beyond a certain bleeding degree the
          wounds won't stop from bleeding all alone, unlike minor bleeding
          wounds. This can happen as a result of several minor bleeding
          wounds or then by just one single seriously bleeding wound from a
          lucky or skilled hit.
          In case of smaller, low endurance animals (like squirrels, birds,
          hares etc.) any bleeding wound is usually fatal, but an elk or
          a bear won't be brought down just as easily anymore.
        * For human NPCs stopping the wounds from bleeding is relatively
          easy although after a heavy bloodloss the battle can be over
          very quickly after fresh bleeding if there hasn't been enough
          time for regeneration - and just like with the player character
          a complete recovery from a heavy bloodloss can take several days,
          even weeks. And do notice that just like the player character
          NPCs will need a combat free zone around them before a wound
          can be treated, so it's best to keep the pressure on if your
          enemy is bleeding badly. 

 - fixed: shelters (mistakenly) providing some basic warmth even without
          fire burning and even during cold weather

 - fixed: foreign traders being willing be to hired by player character

 - fixed: sleeping human NPCs (excluding the Njerpez) not reacting
          aggressively to bow attacks

 - fixed: northern spear not working as a ski stick

 - fixed: rare game freezing bug caused by individual NPC/animal
          structure getting full (in case you had encounter thousands
          of individual creatures)

 - balanced: amount of time required to wear/take off clothes and armours

        It's considerably faster now.

 - re-written: interior area recognition, indoors temperature and
               fireplace checks

        * Previous routines caused problems particularly when smoking meat
          and fish as fireplace recognition was prone to fail occasionally.
          This inconvenience should be history now.
        * Indoors temperature checks are now a bit more realistic which
          means the everlasting basic warmth the houses in previous versions
          provided isn't in effect anymore. During the very cold winter
          days you'll need to warm your house on a daily basis to stay
          comfortably warm. Feeling a little chilly indoors however is
          very, very normal and nothing to be afraid of.
        * Indoors temperature checks now also take into account whether the
          doors are open or shut. So remember to keep your doors shut
          during the cold weather. On the other hand, having the doors
          open can used to cool your house down during hot summer days.

[The latest additions - END]
----------------------------

3.12b bugfix patch 1 & 2 features and general 3.12 additions start here:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - fixed: small lake tiles appearing graphically bugged in "Village" start-up
          scenario

 - fixed: areal zoomed-in item limit (still) occasionally causing new items
          to disappear if they were brought at the location by other means
          than dropping.

        So for example new hides being tanned could still occasionally
        disappear. Item structures are now cleared on the run if necessary
        so all the bugs related to this are hopefully gone for good now.

 - fixed: item duplication bug when [m]oving pile of items

 - fixed: fireplaces not staying heated after the actual fire had burnt out

 - fixed: "TERRAIN KNOWN MISMATCH", which was luckily more of a debug note
          than an actual bug

 - fixed: flying or climbing animals not falling down on the ground even if
          hurt to a degree of making them prone/unconscious

 - fixed: animals/NPCs appearing and being stuck on water/ice tiles

        Animals/NPCs can now walk on ice, and also will not be located
        in the water upon zoomed-in map encounters.

 - changed: lakes won't be frozen anymore as late as in april

        This wasn't a bug, but confusing enough compared to previous versions
        so the ice-cover period has been changed to match the tradition the
        most players we're accustomed to.
              
 - fixed: peas (food) were accepted as a weapon to break ice when making
          hole in the ice

 - fixed: prepared soil (agricultural tile type) being able to catch a fire,
          burn and _disappear_

 - fixed: villagers getting mad if your character attacked a Njerpez at the
          village territory

 - fixed: zoomed-in terrain ground-cover (moss, lichen) not getting cleared
          upon building (a house) on it
 
 - fixed: rare bug causing character to be located on a blank map upon zooming
          in AND being thrown into an endless "loading map" limbo

 - improved: item stacking (especially in case of timber/firewood/branches)

 - fixed: "Fire flames..." notification in case of non-lit fireplace

 - modified: njerpez combat skill averages boosted a bit

	As all the Njerpez are individuals there may still some below 
        average fighters among them, but odds to encounter a more lethal
        Njerpez enemy has been raised. 

 - fixed: items moved or thrown on ice sinking (as the ice was mistakenly 
	  treated as water)
 
 - fixed: bug potential to have buildings (at villages/camps etc.) located
          under the water

 - fixed: task descriptions referring to walk over map border 
          (as being old-school information)

 - fixed: Big Elk-task not completing

 - fixed: villagers getting mad about attacking wild game nearby
          their settlements

 - fixed: (nasty) terrain resetting bug where the zoomed-in
          location you had visited and explored before
          could occasionally become cleared and reset

 - fixed: (rare) bug causing MARKER OVERFLOW warning

 - fixed: (rare) bug causing new items dropped on the zoomed-in
          location erasing some of the items already at the area

 - fixed: storehouse re-stocking

        Storehouses in villages will now re-stock from time to time
        even if the player isn't picking up any goods from them. You didn't
        find that shovel you were looking for? Maybe you should come back
        later on.

 - fixed: eternal flame bug

        If you left a zoomed-in area where a fire was burning, it could
        still be burning when you came back - no matter how long you
        were gone.

 - fixed: fire not burning down the flora

 - floating status of some wooden items checked - including some vital
   elements like rafts and punts

 - balanced prices of overvalued items such as javelins, staffs and clubs

 - fixed: possibility to make squirrels withdraw (and come down) from a tree
 
 - fixed: shutter deconstruction not bringing back the logs used

 - the effect of cold balanced

        You will still be prone to the cold weather just like previously
        but frostbite isn't as common anymore, except in extreme (wintertime)
        conditions.

 - improved: graphics, diversity and generation of zoomed-in maps

        Graphical improvements consist of re-drawn tiles and smoother
        representation of overlapping and curving terrain features,
        smoother seasonal ground/water/ice colouring etc. You'll see.

        * In addition to having just one simple "ground"-tile, we now 
          have a couple different kinds of undergrowth and ground
	  foundation tiles, which define not only the look of
	  the terrain but several other factors as well. 

          The new undergrowth types are:

	  - Lichen

            Lichen mostly appears around pine heathland areas - especially
            in the whole new lichenous pine forest terrain type.

          - Moss

            ...which previously appeared as a tiny, barely noticeable
            tile here and there now forms larger continuous areas and
            has claimed its place as a dominant ground-cover in some
            types of forests and wetland areas.

	  The new ground foundation types are:

          - Bedrock

          Plain bedrock is most commonly revealed on higher cliffs,
          mountain tops and the shores. No trees can grow on bedrock, 
          and shovel work there is naturally useless as well.

          - Crag

          A crag is a rugged, rocky area that appears on the ground, mostly
          at higher heathland areas, shores and mountains. The layer
          of ground on top of the crag is very thin, revealing rocks
          and stones that lay on top of the bedrock. 

	* Notice that the undergrowth (moss and lichen) can also grow where trees and 
	  plants can't, so you may occasionally run into bedrock or crag with your shovel 
          even on a moss-covered forest tile. 

        * All the zoomed-in terrain maps are now generated in more detail and also have 
          stronger terrain type dependant characteristics and landscapes, as they are
	  generated and presented on four levels: 

 	  1) ground foundation
          2) undergrowth
          3) pickable plants/berries/items etc.
          4) trees/boulders/man-made constructions etc.
	 
  	  (Oh, and the fifth element would be the elevation.)

          More ground foundation and undergrowth types are now easy to
	  introduce and will be added later on. 

 - some additions to hypertext game info 

	* "TRACKING" re-written to match the current version
	
        * added new topics: VILLAGE, KOTA and SINGLE FARM.
		
 - villagers now practice a certain discipline as to how one is allowed to
   act in their territory

        You will be verbally and/or physically ordered if you break
        the rules of good behaviour. And if one seems not to learn their
        lesson, at some point the villagers will lose their patience 
        and decide to get rid of you for good.

        Behaviour that isn't allowed anymore would be something like:

        - setting traps
        - felling trees within the village
        - setting a fire in a suspicious location (i.e. next to
          somebody's wall)
        - deconstructing buildings

        ...and so on - go figure  :) 

 - fixed: "Learn a new ritual"-task not getting completed if character
          has already mastered all of the rituals

 - improved: Hiding 

        Hiding works pretty much the same way as previously, but there
        are some changes in game-mechanics:

        * Even though you are moving in an area where there isn't much
          cover to hide behind, hiding now means that you are also trying
          to move as silently as possible. So now it's possible to try to
          sneak closer to a sleeping game animal, for example, even in
          relatively open terrain.
        * Sneaking is prone to physical penalty and agility. Your chances of
          success at moving silently are better if you are lightly equipped,
          don't limp and don't need to cry out in pain every time you move
          your body.
        * Hiding mode will continue until you choose another type of movement
          (running for example) or quit hiding. Hiding isn't automatically
          stopped even if you are notified. If your prey hears you closing
          in, or even spots you, staying still trying to sneak forwards
          after a short pause will sometimes work. Of course only a foolish
          character would keep on hiding and sneak ahead slowly when the
          enemy has clearly seen him and is handling his battleaxe with
          a grin.

 - The biggest and the most fundamental addition in this version is the
   whole new random world generator. Before introducing this major change
   in more detail, let's introduce "the migration" process. This is how
   your old character, from the old world and the previous version of the
   game can be brought into this new version and also have a new world
   created.

   THE MIGRATION (of a saved character from the previous version of the game)

      * Do not uninstall the previous version of the game before your 
        character has been succesfully migrated.
      * Install the new version and copy your character folder from the
        previous installation to the installation folder of this new 
        version.
      * Now as you load your character with the new version a migration
        will start. An information box will appear, telling you pretty
        much same the thing that we describe here now. As you decide to
        proceed with the migration your character will bring along to the 
        new map all the items in your inventory plus all the animals
        and party members you have leashed or nearby you. The migration 
        can be accomplished only when your character was saved on a  
        wilderness scale map. For this reason take some time to play the old
        version to gather your valuables with you and have your companions 
        and animals around you. 
      * Upon migration the old old world you lived in will be completely
        lost and replaced with a new random world. Solid structures can not
        be migrated. Only inventory items, leashed animals and party members.
      * After you've chosen to proceed with the migration, a new random 
        world generator will pop up and you are off to generate a new
        unreal world for your character. Take some time to get to know the
        new landscape as from now on this is the world you'll be living in -
        there's no changing the campaign map after this. (Take a look at the
        section below which covers the new features of the random world
        generator).
      * If you are not satisfied with some aspect of the migration, for
        example location to start on or the area that was migrated, do try it
        again until you are happy with it. For migrating the character again
        quit the game without saving or otherwise delete your character from
        the new installation and proceed again from the top of this list.
        In case of unexpected troubles or in a need for personal migration 
        assistance you can always contact the author.

 - random world generator overhaul (- a monumental task in a nutshell :)

	The random world generator itself has been completely re-written -
        and that means lots of new code and additions all over the game.
	What catches your eye first are the few visual changes in map
        generation and map of known areas displays:

      * The map is six times larger than previously and contains the whole
        UnReal World peninsula.	
      * The look of the random world generator is fresh, but the basic
        controls are the same. You can re-randomize the map and starting 
        location, zoom in and out and see cultural regions and when you are
        happy with the world you just enter and play it.
      * Color indicators of the cultural regions have been modified.
      * In-game display of map of known areas will also show you a little
        navigation box telling you which area of the map is being shown.

        New features of the random world generator itself are:

      * As the map is bigger, it now covers all the cultural regions.
      * A new map is generated only when creating a new character. Once you
        enter the world, there is no longer any need to cross the map border. 
      * Different cultures are spread around the map in the areas we've
        learned to expect them, and now there's also a Njerpez territory in
        the south-east.
      * All the details are randomly generated, but the overall structure of
        the world is somewhat fixed. You will find most of the mountains near
        the northern coast-line. There are major lake-regions, where lakes are
	connected with rivers. The rivers flow all the way down to the sea,
	and sea-water is now distinguished from lakes.        
      * There are also new terrain types:

        - Fortified village. Both the Driikiliset and Njerpezit have some
            of these.
        - Settlement. A newly established house by NPCs. You won't find any
            stores there.
        - Lichenous pine-forest. An area with dry, sandy soil covered with
            lichen. Typically only pine trees grow here.
        - Pasture. An area where animals go to graze. It's mostly grass and
            might have some older trees here and there.  
        - Cliff. Plain exposed bed-rock which grows almost nothing. You
            might only find one or two twisted pines rooted in the crags of
            the cliff.
        - Water tiles now come in different grades of depth. Shallow water is
          where you can wade. Normal water is where you can touch the bottom
          with a sesta, i.e. two or three meters (six to nine feet) deep.
          Everything deeper than that is graded as deep water. 
        - Sea-water has its own tiles.
        - Road. In central areas of some cultural regions you'll find roads
          connecting the villages.

      * Region names are also generated with a whole new algorithm which pays
        attention to whether the area is forest, lake, island, bay, peninsula,
        mountain, hill etc. thus giving meaningful names in finnish. In
        addition to this a (sloppy) english translation of the region names is
        also shown to bring some extra flavour for non-finnish players.

 - added: height curves 

	Terrain height is now generated for the whole random world and
	brings especially the zoomed-in map movement and graphical
        representation up to a whole new level. Different kinds of height
        curves are generated for mountains and hills, swamps and woodland
        areas and all of these blend together to create a seamless
        topographical surface. This beautiful new addition is best seen and
        experienced in the game itself, but a few things worth mentioning
        would be:
      
	* Character's field of vision is (naturally) prone to height curves,
          so some new tactical factors arise; hills, valleys, and ridges can
          provide different kinds of possibilities both for hiding and
          observing your surroundings.

	* There are hills and cliffs of varying steepness. Usually your 
          character will be able to climb up or down a hill just by moving
          normally, sometimes the climbing skill is needed and sometimes
          you may encounter an upright cliff that is just impossible to pass -
          and you have to find an alternative route to reach your destination.
          Differences in steepness are also represented graphically so you'll
          soon learn to read the terrain height at a glance.

        * Even though the graphical and tactical additions brought on by 
          height curves are in effect up to their maximum on the zoomed-in
          maps they also affect the wilderness map. Different terrain types    
          now have a much wider scale in height than the previous basic
          "hills & mountains = high, everything else = low" categorization.
          By wandering on the wilderness map you'll find out that heathlands
          and pine forests range higher than conifer forests, and the swamps
          and wetland areas remain very low. The mountains and hills aren't
          the only lookout terrain types anymore - you can now also stand on
          a high heathland ridge and see backwoods far away and down below
          slowly turning into a wetland area - and so on. In general, the
          forest areas on the wilderness map don't block your eyesight as
          completely anymore as they slope on different levels of height.

- added: Njerpez villages

	As revealed above in the south-east now appears an actual land of
        the Njerpez where your character can also travel to (preferably
        heavily armed). And on their own land the Njerpez live in the
        villages with some storehouses and livestock. As we have learned the
        Njerpez war-parties in the Unreal World do include only men, but in
        their villages you can find Njerpez women also. The land of the
        Njerpez continues to be an unfriendly place to visit but a good
        place for an adventure or revenge. And for the character who is after
        vengeance a carefully-planned attack on their villages may be
        satistactory AND profitable - especially if you happen to find a
        stockpile of loot.

 - added: Better and more fair (player wise) line-of-sight routines for NPCs
          including facing direction

        Line-of-sight is now calculated exactly the same way for you and
        for all the NPCs and animals. NPCs (and animals) also have a facing
        direction which is shown by a little blue arrow on their avatar -
        naturally pointing in the direction they are facing. This brings in
        more tactical possibilities to sneak up on your prey from behind.
        Also, when an alert NPC suddenly turns around 180 degrees to face
        in your direction that should tell you that it probably heard you
        approaching.

 - improved: AI in enemy selection for your party members and dogs 

        Your companions and dogs will now only attack targets that they can
        see. They won't rush away for some random target in the distance like
        previously. As your companions maybe facing in another direction than
        you they can sometimes guard your back very effectively. In case your
        companion doesn't see an enemy to attack, they will attack the enemy
        within your sight.

 - improved: NPC combat AI and maneuvers and morale checks 

        All of these changes apply to all the NPCs - so in the case of
        your companions they are helpful, and in the case of your
        enemies they might be downright nasty. 

        * Weapon wielding: NPCs prefer to wield and use weapons that
          they master the best, or the ones which will cause the maximum
          damage - depending on how they see the situation. NPCs can
          also change their mind and wield another weapon even in the
          middle of the battle if they think it's a good idea.

        * Added archery for NPCs!

          - Not every NPC owns a bow, but those who do and choose to use
            it in a battle can be very dangerous enemies. There are no
            stories (yet) of an adventurer surviving an encounter
            with a party of Njerpez warriors armed with bows.

        * NPC combat morale is calculated in an entirely new, more intelligent
          way and there's also more variety between individual NPCs.
          Basic rules will deal with hits taken and given, and the number
          of fighting men on each side, but you can also expect to
          see some surprising courage, loss of control or a sudden fall
          in morale. Have some fun personal battles! :)

 - improved: Animal morale and approach/hurt/escape behaviour 

        Just like with NPCs you can expect more variety between
        individual animals, even though the main characteristics
        for each species are determined.

        * A whole new behaviouristic feature in addition to plain
          escaping is hiding - which hares and birds (for example)
          tend to do. Now some animals don't necessarily reveal
          themselves to a hunter by escaping right away, but rather
          stay still and hope for the threat to go away. And indeed
          sometimes your prey may be hiding just behind the tree as
          you pass by.

        * Larger beasts, mostly bears, can make false attacks.
          Staying calm while under attack or even taking few bites(!)
          without charging back can sometimes save your life.

        * A desperation factor has also been added and it can sometimes
          turn an escaping, timid beast suddenly aggressive if the animal
          sees charging back as the only way to get rid of a
          tormenting hunter.

        As a result of all the new factors, you can also regularly
        encounter animals that don't behave the way you've learned
        to expect them to behave. For example, you might encounter an elk who
        will calmy stare the approaching hunter in the eye when
        it's more common for them to bolt off into the woods.
        And there might be a pack of wolves that can be scared
        away by throwing a branch at them. General behaviour rules for
        each species are dominant, but every now and then ananimal
        can surprise even an experienced adventurer.

 - added: a description of which direction the attack is coming
          from when you are attacked from behind.

        This is vital information especially when someone is shooting
        arrows at you.

 - added: tracks on the zoomed-in maps

        Wandering animals will now also leave tracks on the zoomed-in maps.
        In the wintertime even the lightest animal will
        leave tracks in the snow, so wintertime is the most fruitful
        hunting season for trackers. When there's no snow on the ground only
        the larger, heavier animals will leave visible tracks - unless the
        soil is suitable (ie. soft and moist) for the lightest prints to
        show.
        Each animal will have their unique tracks shown graphically.
        You will spot tracks automatically when you are nearby them,
        but only from a relatively short distance and this is also
        subject to your character's eyesight. The graphical  
        representation of the track can indicate its age so that
        the freshest tracks can be clearly seen, and the older ones
        are alphablended into the soil according to their age.
        TRACKING-skill itself now works on the zoomed-in map also
        and can be used to tell you details of the tracks at your location. 
        Even if there's no visible tracks in sight you can use the
        TRACKING-skill to look around more carefully and upon success figure 
        out that there actually seems to be a vague trail nearby.

        Even if the animal leaves tracks, it doesn't leave them
        in every location it's at - except when it's walking in
        the snow. As the elk escapes from you and you rush after
        it you will find a track here and another there. Circling
        around, determining the direction of the tracks, some
        good guessing and sometimes returning to the last clear
        track and starting again may be required to stay on the
        trail. But all in all, this is a whole new way to enjoy hunting!

        In the wintertime a hunter who is skiing after his prey
        can build a warm camp for the night, rest and continue
        tracking again in the morning. The tracks will stay there -
        unless it's snowing a lot.

        Also it may be very interesting to come out of your cottage
        in the morning and notice that a bear had been circling around the
        animal pen during the night.

        In the wintertime the tracks of small animals can be fun just
        to find and follow. There may be a surprising amount life around
        you all the time even though your traps stay untouched and
        you've heard nor encountered nothing else for days but the wide
        wilderness humming at your back.

 - fixed: 'figure in distance' being lost after zoomed-in encounter

	The problem we had was: You spot a wandering creature on the
        wilderness map, an encounter happens on a zoomed-in map 
        and as you return to the wilderness map you can't find the
        same 'figure in distance' anymore - even though we all know 
        it's still in the area.

	This has been fixed now: If you lose the creature on the zoomed-in
        map, you may still spot it as a 'figure in distance' on the
        wilderness map.
          
 - zoomed-in locations of wilderness encounters improved

        Upon encountering a wandering animal/human in the wilderness
        the encountered being is now always within the field of vision
        of your character. Even if you haven't explored the zoomed-in map
        before, expect to find some bits of the map already known to you
        after zooming in. This simulates the character being more careful
        when wandering through the terrain prior to encounter, and also
        sometimes needing some circling around the exact location of the
        encounter before spotting the wildlife.

 - fixed: crash potential when dropping the last item from inventory

 - fixed: villages becoming deserted

        The ghost town syndrome is gone for good now. People may
        still wander away from the village for a little while but
        they will return for sure now.

Version: 3.11b
Released: 23-Oct-2008

* This is a hot bugfix release for version 3.11 *

* Saved characters from the previous versions (major version 3.10) are
* compatible with this version to some degree, but do pay attention to
* "PREVIOUS VERSION COMPATIBILITY" information concerning some new features.
* There are known problems with creature porting from earlier versions,
* so if you want to continue playing with your old character it's
* recommended to walk over map border and have a campaign change as soon
* as possible.

Version 3.11b fixes the following:

 - added: maximum time limit for tasks to avoid practically impossible
          tasks being tried, for example: to split boards with stone-axe
          which would require several days to succeed

 - fixed: "You can't use a spoiled" item notification with automatic
          tool selection procdess

 - fixed: northern spear symbol

 - fixed: possibility to command people even if they aren't your companions

 - fixed: crash possibility when zooming in at the area with old-traps

 - fixed: crash possibility when zooming in the villages

          The price for fixing this is the corrupted, old version
          villages propably being completely empty of life.
          (As a bonus you may be able to steal all their goods
           without facing anyone to resist)

 - fixed: attacks from behind by invisible opponents

 - fixed: spoiled food behaving like enchanted weapon when thrown

 - added: option to get back to chat-mode selection screen from
          the main chat screen

 - fixed: dead companions talking

 - fixed: birds being able to fly when trapped

 - fixed: pack of animals freezing when the first one is killed
          real fast

 - fixed: villages getting deserted

        The villagers shouldn't randomly disappear anymore,
        however they may wander even quite far from their homes, but
        should not disappear anymore. Most of the villagers should now
        stay at the village center, some may go wandering nearby
        even for days, but should eventually return.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.11
Released: 17-Oct-2008

* Saved characters from the previous versions (major version 3.10) are
* compatible with this version, but do pay attention to "PREVIOUS VERSION
* COMPATIBILITY" information concerning some new features.
         
 - added game-info on following topics:

        Turnip, Broad beans, Trap-fence, Passive hunting, Log,
        Buildings, Sauna, Slash-and-burn cultivation.

 - updated game-info on following topics:

        Plants, Traps, Fence, Hunting, Fishing

 - added: new key commands to pack/unpack animals

        Pack and unpack options have been removed from the "Extended
        commands" menu and integrated into good old "pick from a
        direction" and "move items" key commands, which now therefore
        have an additional use in packing and unpacking animals.

        What could be more logical than this:

        [;] - "pick items from a given direction" - also works for
              unpacking an animal, if you use it to the direction of
              your pack animal. You can use this command also to pick
              items from your companion, but currently they are only
              willing to hand over their food. 

        [m] - "move items" - also works for packing an animal if you
              use it to the direction of your pack animal.

 - added: overhunt restriction
        
        The number of certain animals at a certain region is now
        limited. So if there's a region with only few elks around
        and they all get killed you won't encounter them no more -
        at least for some time. Animals however can migrate to new
        areas even from great distances, but if you keep on hunting
        at a certain region for a long time you will see the results
        in lack of animals.
          There are some animals (squirrels, hares, birds etc.)
        which are practically too common and numerous to overhunt,
        but for a bearhunter who has managed to bring one down, it's
        a waste of time or a matter of great luck to find another
        within the same or closely neighbouring hunting grounds.
        So you must value your big game from now on.

 - chat overhaul

        All the chat-modes have been integrated into the new chat
        screen (which has been around for few version). The oldschool
        chat-screen with possibility to type in free lines is history.
        As a result of this, some chat-modes and options work temporarily
        on a 'lighter' engine, but will be upgraded and improved in the
        future.

        These are the things that had to go/change:

          - Healers work for free.
          - People tell you tales no more. 
          - Ask for food/drink has been removed.
          - You can't get a wife no more. If you have one already,
            she will wander free. Engagement rites will be added soon
            in a more authentic way.

        So those were the setbacks. How about the good news then:
             
        The bonuses of the chat overhaul are:

          * Instead of pre-generated tales we have seen in the
            past versions, people now tell you news and incidents
            they have seen by themselves or heard about. And these
            are real, working game world events which you can go
            and see for yourself.
            This system replaces the random regional events which
            were used in the past versions. The wolves and the
            Njerpez can cause trouble just like before, but the
            only way to find out about the big news at a certain
            region is to witness them by yourself or to talk to the
            people. When you do greet people, they might tell you
            some news. Some people know a little, some people know
            more and some people know who you should to talk to
            find out more. The news you get can stay at a rumour
            level or then you might get exact directions to the place
            where the bear has been seen or the Njerpez have built
            their war camp. When you hear the news about some topic 
            for the first time, a chat option to talk about it
            will appear in your greeting options the next time you
            talk to someone. This allows you to question people
            and even pick news from a one village and go to the next
            one to see if they know better there. 
            Currently people consider the following events at
            their territory as a news they sometimes want to share:

            - any Njerpez activity/sightings/encounters
            - the bear
            - sightings of wolves or gluttons
            - the lynx
            - foreign traders

          * People give you a bit more verbal description of the
            settlement, lake and cave locations you ask about.
            They also mention the name of the region they are
            talking about. When asking about settlements around,
            you can also ask if they know more distant settlements
            if you think the directions point to the neighbouring
            village you already know.

          * Deliver items chat option is now much more convenient.
            You are allowed to select and deliver items in a row,
            for example when hiring a company, until the person
            is satisfied.

          * There are new "Command" chat-options which allow you
            to command your companion to make a fire, fell down
            trees or to roast the meat/fish he/she has.
            So it's easier to hunt together as you can command your
            companion to roast the meat you gave him while you are
            doing something else. Your companion will also watch
            the food that is cooking and pick up the roasted food
            when it's ready. Also if you hire a company to help you
            build a house, you can command him/her to fall down trees
            while you are making logs and so on. More interactive NPC
            behaviour will be added soon, as the system is now created.

 - when making items etc. the tool selection is now completely automatic

        The best tool for the job - whatever it might be - will be
        automatically selected from your inventory.

 - added: possibility to make batches of items

	This option is restricted only to items that are usually required
        in larger quantities and to maximimum amount of ten batches/pieces
        of a certain item at a time. But yes, now you can make several
        arrows or bunches of wooden stakes with a single make command.

 - game-info browser intergration improved

        Whenever there's game-info browser chapter available about a
        certain matter the first line of the description will be shown
        within "There's more info" pop-up box. This gives you a quick
        sneak preview of the subject. This is useful for example when
        browsing your character's inventory and can lure you to see more
        information about things you thought you already know enough.

        Moreover, game-info about items you can make by yourself, traps
        and so on, is easily accessible from the item/construction
        sub-menus - also with a short teaser description. Similar
        information interface is also added to the culture selection
        menu when creating a character.

 - traps overhaul

        * Game-info on each trap can be accessed directly from
          the trap-menu.

        * Added set and not-set symbols for each different trap.

        * Small and big lever-traps are history.

          These single item traps are replaced by brand new trap
          constructions.

          PREVIOUS VERSION COMPATIBILITY: If you have small or big
          lever-traps with you or set somewhere in the wilderness,
          it's recommended to get rid of them. They either don't work
          anymore, or work in a very odd fashion.

        * Added four new traps: light lever trap plus small, big and
          heavy deadfall trap.

	  So there's something new to learn as for which animals and
          how these traps work, and what is required to construct them
          by yourself. These traps are constructions, not single items.
          So they are built at the location and will stay there until
          disassembled.

	* Added new trap-menu option: "Disassemble"

          In case of a trap construction you can disassemble the
          construction down to its' original parts and raw materials.
          In case of a single item trap (fox trap or loop snare)
          disassembling will trigger the trap allowing you to pick
          it up.

	* "Cover" trap-menu option removed.
	  
          Traps which need to be covered to be effective are now
          automatically covered when they are set, thus covering
          isn't something you need to do manually anymore.

	* Pits and holes aren't traps by default anymore. 
 
          Only the act of making a trap-pit (from the trap-menu) will
          turn a pit or a hole in the ground into a trap-pit. In this
          process the pit gets covered and optionally improved with
          sharp stakes. You can also freely walk into plain pits or
          triggered trap pits without risk of getting hurt. 

          PREVIOUS VERSION COMPATIBILITY: All the trap-pits you have made
          in the previous version will appear as a plain pits in this
          version. You must use the current version trap options to make
          them trap-pits again.

       	* Added new trap-menu option: "Reset triggered trap construction"

          Resetting a triggered trap works only for trap constructions,
          not trap items (like fox trap or loop snare). Resetting means
          fixing the triggered trap and setting it again to be ready for
          another prey. In case of a trap pit this means covering the pit
          again. In other cases this means fixing and resetting the
          triggering mechanism etc. Usually this doesn't require any extra
          equipment or materials; just simply using the same spruce twigs
          and branches again to cover the trap pit or to pulling the same
          deadfall up again and setting the triggering stick etc.

        * Traps do attract the animals they are designed for more
          efficiently.

          The trap type and design has now more effect in what kind of
          animals will get caught in it. Generally the animals won't be
          attracted of the trap at all if it's designed for significantly
          different species.

 - added: natural holes in the ground as a zoom map terrain feature

        You can occasionally find naturally formed holes in the ground
        on the zoomed in maps. The holes can be utilized in building
        a trap-pit at the location if one finds it reasonable.

 - added: notification when a settlement not known to you earlier appears
   in your view

 - effect of the cold weather balanced

        In general you don't get frostbites that easily anymore and
        you will be notified about your bodyparts getting cold earlier
        than before. You can get such notifications even on a
        cold autumn night if you are dressed lightly. But the frostbites
        are something don't need to be worried about until winter.

 - tile-graphics overhaul + other fresh graphics

        * Most of the tiles have been re-drawn, especially the ones
          representing the terrain. And this is because we have
          overlapping tiles now! The game looks a lot different compared
          to previous version, but you'll surely get used to it.
          This is a kind of improvement that is better to see than
          to read about, so this is all I write about it :)

        * Added different kind of door and shutter tiles depending on
          the wall they are at.

        * A bunch of fresh pictures:
          - background picture for the ritual screen
          - walking, running, fallen and hiding character pictures
          - village
          - your settlement
          - fence (in game-info)

 - Statistics screen has been slightly re-arranged and stylized

        In addition to hunger and thirst meters, you can also see your
        characters' warmth and level of exhaustion as a verbal
        descriptions.  Notice that the warmth of your character isn't
        updated immediately after wearing or removing clothes, or warming
        up by the fire. Also when you leave your cosy campfire or house
        you will only gradually start to cool down - which is a good
        thing thinking about the cold winter.
                
 - fixed: rare bug where walking on the zoomed in map sometimes ended up
          in a generation of a blank terrain

 - fixed: time not passing when using "rest a turn" key command: [.]

 - fixed: a human encounter on the wilderness map producing wrong
          cultural description 

 - fixed: "learning by doing" task not completing

 - fixed: time-counter of items being prepared not passing correctly
          while sleeping

          This was mostly a matter of food not cooking while sleeping.

 - map marker structures re-organized to fix badly aligned shelter and
   settlement markers nearby the coast-line 
	  
        PREVIOUS VERSION COMPATIBILITY: You will temporarily lose map
        markers of your old traps, nets and shelters. When you locate
        them again and visit the zoomed in area they are at, the markers
        will be activated again. You can also expect to be not zoomed
        in your old settlements automatically at first.

        The good news are: Shelters and settlements built nearby the
        coast-line don't have their markers located on the water
        anymore.

 - NPC artificial intelligence improved

        * All the NPCs and animals as well can now go around obstacles
          in a more intelligent fashion. People can also easily enter
          and leave houses now, for example as an attack or an escape
          maneuver.
        * When the night falls the people will go sleep inside.
        * The villagers keep up fires, fell down trees and do
          other little activities instead of just randomly walking
          around.

 - fixed: people occasionally wandering away from clustered or closely
          neighbouring villages leaving them empty

 - added: more specific nutritional values for different kind of food

        For starters this applies only to the amount of energy you get
        from a certain food. Fatty meat and rye bread satisfies your
        hunger way more efficiently than berries and mushrooms.
        Notice that this applies only to the new food you find in
        the game, if you are playing with your old character. The
        food generated in the previous versions will have the same
        average nutritional value as before.
        Now that the system has been implemented a more detailed
        nutritional values can be easily added later on.

 - added new cookery recipe: meat soup

 - throw command re-written

        First of all it fixes the bug where you couldn't throw
        an item from your inventory if wielding something already.

        Improved/fixed throw features go like this:

        * If you are wielding bow and arrow a bow shot
          will be executed upon "Throw" command.
        * If you are wielding a bow and select an arrow to be
          thrown, the bow will be loaded and a bow shot will
          be executed.
        * If you are wielding something else than a bow and
          arrow you can choose the item to be thrown from
          the inventory. If your both hands are already in use
          you can only throw one of your weapons.
        * If you throw something into a solid obstacle the item
          thrown will bounce and land nearby the obstacle,
          except the arrows which will hit and get stuck - or break.
        * If you throw something into the water it will sink
          and vanish with a splash, except the items that float.
          Currently only timber and few rare smaller items
          will float, so be careful when throwing your goods into
          the water.
        * There's a limit how far you can throw heavy items.
          Missile weapons designed for throwing and arrows
          will naturally fly beautifully over the great distances,
          but for example heavy axes and swords can't be used as
          a long distance throwing weapons anymore. And the
          heavy kaumolais spear also now claims its' place as a
          close combat weapon. You can throw it if you like,
          but as a missile weapon it is heavy, clumsy and
          inaccurate.

 - fixed: possibility to build something at the location with
          items being prepared (food cooking, hides getting tanned etc.)

 - fixed: move command still relocating items even if the task
          was cancelled

 - added limit for picking up heavy loads

        Every character can pick up a load of approximately 1.5 times
        their weight. Depending on the characters' total encumbrance and
        endurance it may still be impossible to move with such a burden
        even if it was possible to lift it up.

 - animal behaviour improved

        * Birds

        Birds will fly around their territory, occasionally
        landing on the ground to search for food, eat or to
        spend a night. Birds can also land on top of the
        trees and stay there resting or looking around.
        They also don't tend to be too scared of other
        beings when flying or sitting in a tree, but will
        escape with a rustle if surprised on the ground.
        A good hit to a flying or sitting bird will drop
        it down and somewhat injured bird can't get on its'
        wings anymore.

        Bird also do have a separate "on the ground" and "flying"
        graphical symbols now.

        * Squirrels

        Squirrels behave pretty much the same as previously,
        running between trees, climbing and jumping from
        tree to tree. Squirrels also feel more safe when
        up in a tree, thus providing a more static target for a
        squirrel hunter. A good hit to a squirrel will drop it
        down, usually injuring it up to a degree where it becomes
        impossible for the animal to climb up again.

        Any animal flying through a tree or sitting or climbing
        up there will have its' graphical symbol shown halved/blurred
        representing the animal being covered by the leaves and
        branches.

        * All the other animals do move around with a little more
          logic in their heads. They can escape in a more clever way,
          or circle around you and attack from behind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
version: 3.10-2 
released: 10-Jun-2008

** Saved characters from the previous versions (major version 3.10) 
** are compatible with this version.

** BACKUP YOUR CHARACTER FOLDER FROM THE PREVIOUS INSTALLATION BEFORE
** INSTALLING THE NEW VERSION, THEN COPY IT TO URW FOLDER OF YOUR NEW
** INSTALLATION.

 - fixed: animal skin values

        Hides gotten during  any other season than late autumn or winter
        appeared pretty much worthless.

 - fixed: animal mobility checks
 
        One could too easily run after and reach most escaping
        animals. And vice versa. Now animals are in general faster
        than a running man - but stil do have their unique mobility rates.
        With a fast, not too encumbered character, running down for
        example a hare is still possible. But when a bear rushes at you
        at the open area, you don't turn around and run and survive.

 - fixed: crash/oddity possibility when picking up a food with longish
          description

        Luckily this was only linked to such a delicacy like
        'Roasted kuikka-tribe adventurer cut' and such.

 - very long item description lines in the inventory menu are cut to prevent
   them overwriting other details

 - inventory-screen keyboard interface improved

        * Inventory page will be switched when moving the item selector
          with cursor up/down keys over the page boundary.
        * When switching pages with PgDn/PgUp the item selector at the next
          page will be located according to its' location at the previous
          page.
        * When there's only one inventory page or you are at the last page,
          pressing PgDn will move the item selector to the last entry.
        * At the first page of inventory, pressing PgUp will move the item
          selector to the first entry.

 - inventory item re-ordering after usage restrained

        When eating, using or by other means consuming food or some raw
        material from a stack, the re-ordering of the remaining stack
        should be less all over the inventory now.

 - fixed: weapons thrown and hitting succesfully at small animals (like
          squirrels) disappearing

 - fixed: "you can't eat the whole [random object] at a time" notification

 - fixed: possibility to move on an obstacle with a watercraft       

 - fixed: animals being able to climb and fly when caught in a trap

 - skill improvement overhaul

        The old rule of improving skills by using them still applies,
        but has been balanced allowing skill usage to improve a certain
        skill faster or slower according to how challenging or
        educational the task is. When a skill usage is called to
        perform a certain task, the improvement possibility of the skill
        can be negligible, rare, propable or very propable.

        An example:

        A negligible skill improvement can be expected when using a
        timbercraft skill for cutting wooden stakes. Felling small trees
        can be considered as rarely improving the skill. Felling big
        trees is harder and propably will teach you something.
        And your timbercraft skill will very propably improve
        in a log wall building process.

        Notice that the improvement is still possible with doing less
        challenging tasks, but no way you can expect to become a master
        timbercrafter with easy wood cutting exercise only.

        The old rules of skills improving faster when your mastery
        level is low, and the learning slowing down when you
        gain more knowledge, are still true and even more in effect.

        All in all, the skill improvement system works now in a much
        more realistic manner, and the no pain no gain slogan applies
        also to the UnReal World.

 - removed possibility to eat salt (directly from a bag)

 - eating raw meat/fish is possible only when very hungry

 - added quality tags for the food descriptions

        You'll find out if your meal came out awful, bland or
        delicious when you taste it the first time. When there's no
        special quality tag it means the food is plain good.

 - added quality tags for fresh skins and prepared hide/leather:

        They are:

        Ragged, Inferior, - (no special tag means plain good) and Fine

        You'll find out the quality of the prepared hide/leather
        when the tanning process is complete. You can't also never
        get a superb hide out of a very low quality skin.

 - fixed: game-course bonus features and rewards happening again
          after saving and loading the character again

 - fixed: multiple items being cooked not appearing as a graphical
          stack

 - fixed: rare freezing conflict with UrW, Windows and ntdll.dll upon
          displaying start screen graphics

----------------------------------------------------------------------
version: 3.10-1 
released: 5-May-2008

** Saved character from the major version 3.10 are compatible with this version. **

 - fixed: skiing not stopping even if the skis were taken off

 - fixed: character getting sleepy too fast

 - fixed: dead shopkeepers still trying to trade. Very persistent businessmen!

 - fixed: stacks of traps in inventory reducing down to a quantity
   of one if a trap was set (applied) from the stack

 - fixed: an occasional bug that caused prepared food on the ground
   to corrupt when cancelling the progress of a certain item based
   tasks

 - fixed: walking on the zoomed in map not increasing hunger, thirst
   nor fatigue

 - usage of pots and water containers improved

        * "Fill a container" command now also works as an "empty
          a container" command. If you try to fill a container
          that has something in, the container will be emptied first.
          In case of liquid-only containers the re-fill questions
          automatically follows. In case of pots, the pot will
          be only emptied. This way you can throw away your spoiled
          morning porridge.

        * Pots filled with water will be automatically emptied
          if they are selected as a required item when cooking etc.

  - fixed the time required for curing and tanning

        * Fixed: curing being instant. Now it takes some time
          depending on the skin size.
        * Time required to tan skins  now better corresponds to the
          skin size. Previously it took always more than an hour
          to tan even a small skin, now less than half an hour
          of work is needed for squirrel skins for example. Bigger
          skins, like those of elks and bears, may require working
          for few hours.

 - fixed: exploit to make a brand new bandages from a strip of bandage

        + similar exploits due to too broad-minded margin in amount
          of required raw material.

 - allowed possibility to build a fire to a location that can't be
   seen for the sake of surviving at the pitch-dark winter nights

 - increased the amount of time before the prepared food is overcooked
   and spoiled for the sake of more relaxed gameplay

 - when using the same inventory command in a row the inventory
   will be shown starting from the same entry where you were last time.

 - protection value of the clothes you make is now dependent from the
   type of the leather/hide used

        In brief: a bear fur shirt protects you better than a hare
        fur shirt - in general. But notice that the clothes (and the
        animal skins) have more than one protection factor, so a
        thick leather may be as protective against blunt attacks
        as most hides are, but surely it is not so warm.
           The hide type is now also included in the name of the
        finished cloth, so you'll have a bear fur caps and a cow
        leather shirts now. If you mix hide or leather of different
        animals the finished cloth will be descriped simply as a "fur
        cloak", for example, and the protection value will be the
        average of the materials used. However if a significant
        amount of the material is of a certain type, the finished
        cloth will be labeled and valued according to that. So it's
        possible to  make a wolf fur cloak even if you needed a few
        strips of squirrel in the end.

 - success in skinning the carcass has effect now

        The more you fail the less skin you'll get. Otherwise the
        success (depending on the hideworking mastery) affects
        the time required to skin the carcass. Protective value of
        the skin stays the same whether you succeed perfectly or
        manage to get only a strip of the skin, so this mainly has
        effect on trading - the smaller the skin the lesser the value.

 - success in tanning has more effect now

        Very poor or very good success in tanning is notified in 
        the produced hide/leather description -> "Poor bear hide",
        "Fine cow leather" etc. In the clothmaking this has no
        effect, for a badly tanned hide may not be very flexible
        but has the same protective value. In trading there
        is a significant difference in the price between a poor
        and a fine hide.

 - fixed a bug where the consumption of items in inventory affected to
   similar items on the ground

        So you could have a wooden tub of water emptying in your
        cottage by drinking from one in your inventory. Same thing
        with the food also. Wow. A far out bug. Very magical. But it
        had to go.

  - fixed items not stacking when eating or drinking from a stack

  - fixed annoying inventory re-ordering method upon using items
    (eating, drinking, wearing, wielding)

        For example: now your stack of bread won't keep jumping
        up and down the inventory every time you touch it.

  - fixed black grouse skin and fat having negative weight and thus
    causing various oddities in inventory

  - fixed item descriptions being in plural with single items also

  - barking barks removed (nevermind, if you haven't ran into this
    "feature")

  - when playing game-courses the next task information will be
    displayed automatically upon character load and after completing
    the current task

  - weight of the logs, tree trunks and blocks of wood corrected

        The changes however won't apply to the characters created in
        the previous version until a campaign change. Trunks and logs
        are now as heavy as they should be.

  - fixed: burnt out torches not disappearing from the inventory

  - added possibility to use item hotkeys in inventory to
    select items also from a non visible next/previous page

  - fixed: creatures not walking over the carcasses

  - foreign traders' inventories arranged a bit to offer more trading
    possibilities

  - fixed exploit: possibility to repeat-fish on the wilderness map

  - fixed: deconstruction of sleeping bunk, table, bench and fireplace
    clearing out as a ground instead of a floor

  - removed character waking up when learning a new ritual or feeling
    the presence of the supernatural world

        The ritual screen also won't pop up upon this encounter
        when there's already a new ritual still to be learned
        or if all the rituals have been already learned.

  - fixed: skills with a high mastery level decreasing after a ritual
    that temporarily improves the skill 

  - fixed: crash possibility upon talking to a wise man to learn a
    new ritual

----------------------------------------------------------------------
version: 3.10 
released: 22-Apr-2008

*** NOTICE! Saved characters from the previous versions
*** are NOT compatible with this version.                                             

 - added a new command: [m]ove items

        By this command you can move select items at your location
        to a chosen nearby location. The command is useful for
        filling a fireplace or adding more firewood to a burning
        fire, or moving a pile of heavy logs to another location
        etc.

 - fixed the time passing too quickly when walking on the zoomed in map

 - wilderness encounter randomization re-written

        * The cultural region (east, west, north) has effect on 
          how common a certain species is at the region - or if it's
          present at all. Few examples:
          - Arctic fox is most common in the north, and completely
            in the west.
          - Elks become rare the norther you go, and the wild
            reindeers become more common naturally
          ...and so on.

        * Domestic animals don't appear in the wilderness anymore

        * Squirrels, hares and foxes are the most common animals
          in general. All the other animals still roam the
          UnReal World also but can't be expected to see as often
          as previously.

        * Humans are more rare in the wilderness. The foreign people,
          including both Njerpez and foreign traders, visit the northern
          areas very rarely. Foreign traders are most common in the
          west, and Njerpez warriors - if you want to meet them -
          do raid the eastern UnReal World most often.

        * Beavers exist only nearby the water

        * In general the wilderness encounters have been balanced
          and made more realistic.

 - added possibility to choose whether you want to zoom into a local
   map to chase encountered animals if they are relatively small

        Sometimes you may want to travel on the wilderness map without
        automatically getting zoomed in when a small animal is
        encountered.
        Encounters with humans and larger animals are always
        automatical and have to be dealt on the zoom map.

 - wild reindeer is now known as forest reindeer

 - weight of the meat and skin gotten from slain animals have been
   checked and tuned to better reflect the actual real-life weights

        So forget what you have been used to in the previous
        versions.

 - added variying size for the animals

        When looking at animals you may find a description like
        "Big elk" or "Small lynx". Now there are bigger and smaller
        individuals of each animal, and also the average ones.
        This way you can  go for the bigger animals when choosing
        your prey from a flock of reindeers for example. Amount of
        skin and meat gotten from the slain animal is also relative
        to its' size.

 - added possibility to offer multiple items when trading

 - "How many?" box re-written

        When there's need to select a number of items (for example
        when picking up from a stack) the "How many?" question box
        will pop up. Good old [ENTER] selects all, and keys from
        1-9 selects the appropriate amount, without need to press
        enter afterwards. For picking up a freely chosen item count
        you need to press [SPACE] and enter the number. "How many?"
        question box is also mouse sensitive.

 - game-courses and task info screen improved and updated

        There are now three game-courses, instead of previous four,
        but the tasks in each now differ more than previously and
        there's less repetition and also a bunch of whole new tasks.
        Task info screen also now shows you related key commands to
        complete the task thus making the game-courses more
        convenient for UnReal World rookies.

 - fixed a bug that made it possible to pick up an item that is still
   being prepared if there were other items at the same location

 - a larger number of items on the ground will also be shown graphically
   as a bunch of items

 - fixed the possibility of catching a large number of a species of fish
   which actually wander alone or in small groups

        So don't expect to catch several pikes etc. at once anymore.

 - a new inventory menu

        The inventory menu, from where you select items to eat, 
        wear, drop, use and so on, has been rewritten.  The new
        menu works in the same way as the previous one but has a new
        look and is completely mouse sensitive.  Usage of drinks
        and foods, condition of armours and clothes etc. is also
        shown graphically instead verbal description.

 - added mouse sensitive item selection list for picking up items

        Now you can select items to pick up freely from a list.

 - added a bunch of new items

        * A stone. These can be found on the zoomed in terrain maps.
          Stones are needed for some building jobs.

        * A board. Boards can be made from big tree trunks with the
          timbercraft skill and are used in some construction tasks.

        * 4 new axes: broad axe, woodsman's axe, carving axe and
          splitting axe. The new axes have unique graphical
          symbols of their own and characteristics that make them
          more handy in some tasks than in others. Check out the
          descriptions for the new axes in the game-info browser to
          learn more.

 - separate survival skill options for collecting branches and
   spruces twigs have been merged into a one single option

        When using the "collect branches" survival option the type of
        branches gathered depends on  the tree you're collecting from.  
        From conifers you get spruce twigs, all others will produce 
        branches.

 - many game-screens have been graphically renewed and made
   completely mouse sensitive:

        * Character profile screen.
        * Random world creation screen. There's now also an option
          to view the cultural territories of the created world.
        * Map of know areas. You can view cultural territories from
          here also.
        * Ritual screen, armour coverage and wounds screens are
          now completely mouse sensitive, including the possibility
          to launch the game-info browser by pointing and clicking. 
        * Skill-screen has been graphically renewed and is now
          completely mouse senstive. Yes, you can point and click
          a skill to use it. And yes, you can improve your start-up                                
	  skills during character creation also by pointing and
          clicking.
        * Game-course selection screen.
        * Game-info browser. It's completely mouse sensitive now.
          Just point and click to follow the links.
        * Character log. Options to turn pages to a certain day or
          month are temporarily disabled, but will be restored later
          on.
        * List of game-commands (?-key) screen.

 - "You have gotten lost" random encounter has been removed.

 - changes in cookery and recipes

        * There's now only a single long list of recipes, instead of
          sub-categories.
        * A few recipes, for example fish soup and veggie dish, have
          been removed to be added later on with more detail.
        * Boiled mushrooms are now blanched mushrooms.
        * When food is made in a pot, you'll find the prepared
          food listed under FOODS in your inventory.  Naturally
          this kind of food needs to be eaten, instead of drank 
          like previously. When you have eaten all of your
          pot of porridge for example, the pot will appear empty
          in your inventory under DRINKS & CONTAINERS.
        * Added a new recipe: Smoked fish.
        * Preparing salted meat or salted fish now takes up to a few
          days, instead of a few hours like previously.
        * When salt is required in cookery,  the amount of salt
          needed is relative to the amount of food being prepared.
        * It's now possible to bake flat bread in the embers of a
          burned-out campfire in addition to baking it in a
          fireplace - which previously was the only option.

 - smoother changes in the color of the ground according to the
   season

        There are now some 20 shades of ground, so you'll  see
        the ground turning green in the spring and white in the
        winter in a much smoother manner.

 - estoc, rapier, falchion,  morningstar  and  warflail  have been
   completely removed because they actually belong to an entirely
   different historic era

 - added a new command to repeat the last action

        Key-command for this is <r> - and you just can't forget it
        since the last repeatable action and this little but powerful
        key-command are continuosly shown on the main game-screen. 
        Now you can repeat virtually EVERY action you ever perform 
        in the game.  For the sake of usefulness, minor actions (like 
        eating or dropping items) don't overwrite the last repeatable 
        action.

 - "required item selection" overhaul

        This is a major change which greatly affects gameplay,
        making it smoother and more realistic when it comes to the
        role of specific tools for specific tasks.
        "Required item selection"-screen is the one that pops up
        when you need to select ingredients for cooking or materials 
        for building and so on.  The improvements here
        are:
        * If you are wielding any tools that are required for the
          task you are performing, the wielded tools will be
          automatically selected if they are suitable for the
          task. If you are wielding more than one tool, the more
          suitable one for the task will be selected.
        * Some tools are better suited for certain tasks than others
          and the tool chosen will affect the success of the task
          as well as the time required to perform it. When a
          specific tool is preferred for a certain task, you'll 
          be notified about this during item selection:
          "You need an axe - preferably a woodsman's axe" etc.
          You'll also be notified if the item you are using is
          poorly suited for the current task. It is possible to
          perform a task that prefers (for example) a specific axe
          with nearly any axe, but the work is easier and the
          result is better when you use the proper tool for the job. 
          Sometimes two different types of axe may be required
          for the task to complete it most efficiently. This
          is the case for example when building log walls.
        * When multiple items are required you can select them
          from separate item stacks. For example if you need 2lb.
          of water, and have a pot of water and a skin of water
          with 1 lb. left in each, you can select one of them and
          the "item selection"-screen simply prompts you to
          select additional units until the required amount is
          achieved.  You can now also select multiple small pieces 
          of fur to complete a piece of clothing that requires 
          more fur than you have in one single piece.  Also,
          if the task requires five pieces of tying equipment you
          can use three cords and two ropes if that's what you have.
        * If the task to be done gets cancelled after the required
          items are selected, the chosen items won't vanish but
          return in your inventory.
        * Sometimes you may be asked for optional but not
          necessary items, for example in some cookery recipes.
          Just exit the item selection if you don't want to use
          or don't have the optional items.

 - building construction is now a tile-by-tile procedure.

        You can now freely choose whether you want to build a corner
        here or a wall there.  The shape and size of the building isn't
        restricted at all anymore. You can also build shutters, doors,
        tables, benches, sleeping bunks and fireplaces!
	There's also a new option to  deconstruct  things you have
        built, so you can remove a wall, a door, a shelter etc. if
        necessary.

 - changes in make items/constructions menu
                                                                 
        * Separate fur and leather clothing sub-categories have been
          merged into one single list of clothes to make.
        * Fence and cellar building options now appear  in  the  buildings
          sub-category.
        * Some constructions now require boards in place of logs.
          One example is when building a cellar - which also no longer
          requires you to dig a pit before building, although you do still need
          a shovel to build one.
   
 - militant style, armed elder tribesmen have been removed.

        In their stead you'll now meet some old villagers.

 - culture information added to NPC descriptions

        From now on you'll find NPCs like "Kaumolais hunter", 
        "Owl-tribe maiden", "Sartolais sage" etc.

 - added unique graphical symbols for the peoples of the three major
   cultural regions.

        Thus eastern, western and northern people look a bit
        different.

 - all the human NPCs are generated in a more detailed and versatile
   fashion

        Each human NPC is generated individually, instead of the
        previously used less-varying pre-randomization method.

 - culturally linked items

        All of the items that people use, carry, possess and craft now
        differ from culture to culture.
        This goes for hunting weapons, bows, armour types,
        tools, even their knives.  There are some clear and strong
        differences and characteristics. For example:  A koivulais
        hunter will carry different kinds of equipment than a
        kiesse hunter.  A bowyer from Reemi won't make the same
        types of bows that can be found in Driik.  If an islander prepares
        himself for warfare, he'll be carrying different weapons
        than what a kaumolais warrior would have etc. The items you
        can obtain from the craftsmen at the villages  are also
        culturally linked, so if you are after Driik-style weapons
        you really need to go to Driik for them.  And if you'd
        like to get yourself a northern bow, then to the north you must
        go. So now there is a real chance of cultural exchange, and
        the only way to find out what a certain cultural region
        could offer to you is to go there and see for yourself.
        You may want to read more information about the cultures from
        the game-info browser, as culture now has a much greater impact 
        on the game-world than ever before.

 -  culturally linked start-up equipment

        The start-up equipment your character gets are also culturally
        linked so you'll get only items that are characteristic to the
        culture you have chosen.

 - a change in tanned skin description

        If the tanned skin is fur the description after tanning will be an
        animal hide ("Bear hide" for example). Tanned skin of non fur-bearing
        animals is decriped a leather (for example "Cow leather").

 - amount of firewood you get from one block of wood has been corrected.

        You'll get more firewood per block than previously, the actual
        amount that corresponds to the original weight of the block.
        Annotation: a splitting axe is the best tool to use for splitting
        firewood.

 - direction and target selection stylized a bit

        The look of the direction and target selection info-box is new,
        and you can also use the mouse to select the desired location
        when choosing the direction of an action.

 - some changes in sub-menu hotkeys, descriptions of  actions  and
   in times and materials required to complete certain tasks.

        Just minor changes and tuning here and there, nothing 
        too confusing.

version: 3.04-2 - a bugfix patch for version 3.04
released: Jan-08-2007

*** CHARACTERS FROM VERSIONS 3.04 and 3.04-1 ARE COMPATIBLE WITH ***
*** THIS VERSION.                                                ***

 - fixed key commands occasionally not working when  entering  the
   game
        
        Phew! This annoying show stopper  bug  is  now history. It
        was launched if your last action prior  to   entering  the
        main game screen was a mouse click.

 - fixed hiding making the game really laggy sometimes

 - fixed occasional crash when looking at certain creatures

        This was caused by string a overflow, with  creature names
        such as "Elder tribesman called 'Matti'".

 - added avatar graphics with fallen symbols

        Thanks for fallen avatar symbols go to nickname  "Eternal"
        from UrW-forums.
------------------------------------------------------------------
version: 3.04
released: Dec-16-2007

 - a new installer 

 	The look of the  installer  is  fresh,  and  now  it  also 
	creates a start menu folder for the  game  with unistaller
	and list of new features shortcuts.

 - savefile size reduced

	It's starting to be reasonable now.

 - fixed map screen [F6] sometimes getting filled with markers

        Although I wasn't able to completely find out which caused
        the bug to appear I think the map screen is less prone  to
        it now.

 - slight tuning in map genarator

        * amount of inland area lakes recuded
        * amount of villages (especially in archipelago) reduced
        * close groups of settlements (driikilis  and   reemilis
          villages) made slightly smaller - but not too much -  as
	  their density is intentional

 - introducing a new creature randomization system as  applied  to
   Njerpez warriors and foreign traders

         Now Njerpezit and foreign traders  will  be  created  and
         randomized as you encounter them.  Pre-randomizing system
         isn't applied to them anymore. This way the new Njerpezit
         and foreign traders  you  encounter  will  be  completely
         different individual beings everytime.  Previously  there
         was  less   variation   and  only  a bunch  of  different
         pre-randomized beings among them. In the future  all  the
         beings of the UnReal World will be included  in  the  new 
         new randomization system.

 - removed excess amount of swords and metal armours from  Njerpez
   warriors and foreign traders

         Foreign traders still carry metal  armours  for  trading,
         but this is more balanced now and not everyone of them is
         packed with several pieces of armour.
         Variety of weapons and armours the Njerpez  warriors will
         carry  is  also  balanced  and  there  aren't  that  many
         swordsmen among them anymore.

 - fixed bug with food left in the cellar spoiling  quickly  after
   taking it out

 - removed possibility to choose another  starting  scenario  upon
   changing campaign

 - fixed bug potential code in data structures

         Various item related bugs and oddities, like hides to  be
         cured appearing as *unmatchablestring*s etc., might  have
         been result of the found and now fixed bug potential code.
         
 - swimming improved

         SWIMMING-skill is now merely a zoom-map  skill.  To swim,
         your character must be facing towards the water and  upon
         using the skill he/she will enter the  water. After  this
         you only need to move your  character  normally  to  swim
         around.
         If  the   characters'  physical  penalties  (encumbrance,
         fatigue, injuries) make the swimming considerably  harder
         you will be notified about it when  entering  the  water,
         and also during swimming if they grow up to risky levels.
         Fatigue keeps growing as you swim and it may tire up your
         character to the point of drowning.
         You can also rest while swimming by using key command [.]
         but can still sink under the water.
         With a low swimming  skill  your  character  more  likely
         doesn't manage to  progress forwards than be in danger of
         of drowning fast.
         If your character keeps sinking under the water it should
         be taken as a warning. Three consecutive sinks result  in 
         passing out and drowning.
         Swimming nearby the coast-line or in small  ponds,  where
         the water isn't deeper than your height,  is  always risk
         free.
         Swimming in rivers is more difficult and in rapids it can
         get really, really hard.

  - natural attack damage levels reasoned

         Maximum damage factor has  been  added  to  prevent  some 
         animals to cause too much injury with  a  single  attack.
         This has been applied mostly to attacks  of  smaller  and
         less dangerous animals. Now there's  no  way  a  fox  can
         cause bleeding wounds thru any thicker armour, or a sheep
         kill you instantly with a  kick  in  the  neck.  Now  the
         badgers can't rip off your arms nor you need to be afraid 
         of beavers easily gnawing you to pieces.
            As a result of adding maximum damage  factor,  wearing
         any   reasonably   thick  armour  will  protect  armoured
         bodyparts from  attacks  of  smaller  animals practically
         completely.
            Humans also had  tendency  to  act  like  ninjas  when
         unarmed, kicking you easily  in  the  head. Now this kind
	 of unarmed attacks are directed to the body area.
            Some sudden and fatal  damage  can  still happen,  but
         this  should be more rare and within  reason  now.  There
         could be a furious wolf going for your unprotected throat
         and finishing you with a single crushing bite or a horn 
         of a wild bull might hit you right in the eye etc.

  - ritual screen slightly re-arranged

         You can now choose general ritual information by pointing
         and  clicking  [R]  button  with  mouse.  The  same thing
         applies to [ESC] button also. When the  screen  is  shown
         upon character creation or when learning a new ritual you
         can't exit it (confusingly) by selecting a ritual  -  now
         it must be done by clicking or pressing [ESC].
         A small info box will  keep  you informed about available
         options.

------------------------------------------------------------------
version: 3.03.1 - first bugfix patch for 3.03
released: Oct-31-2007

CHARACTERS FROM VERSION 3.03 ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THIS VERSION.
--------------------------------------------------------------

 - fixed "Trade by barter" task completion not working properly

 - fixed villagers travelling too far away from village center

         Especially medicine  men,  children  and  women won't go
         wandering away from the village area anymore.
 
 - possibility to find a medicine men in villages increased

 - character will be able to sleep even when very hungry or thirsty

         The sleep will be shorter and not   as   refreshing  but 
         possible.

 - humans don't have a neurotic urge to drop their items in buildings
   or building sites anymore

 - decreased possibility of encountering creatures  on  areas  with 
   animals or humans already 

         Wildlife will avoid this kind of areas so you don't  end 
         up finding a zoo at your backyard as (annoyingly) easily 
         as previously.
	 Moreover now it's pretty  useless  to  try  to  encounter 
         random wildlife when traveling with two cows, a wife  and
         a barking dog etc.
         Encountering wildlife in villages is also fixed.

 - fixed warnings in code which MAY HAVE caused some problems with
   UrW and Windows Vista.

         However, I can't be 100% sure of this, so please send me
         reports of game crashing if you happen to get some.

------------------------------------------------------------------
version: 3.03
released: Oct-11-2007

*** NOTICE! Saved characters from the previous versions are NOT compatible ***
***         with this version.                                             ***

 - fixed possibility to burn down caves

 - random world options menu after map creation is now mouse sensitive

        It works the same way, all the hotkeys also, expect  that 
        you zoom into 1:1 view with 'Z' key instead of ENTER.

 - swimming balanced a bit

        It's a bit easier on the wilderness map now,  and  a  bit
        more difficult on the zoom map.

 - the fish stuck in a net will die if not picked up soon enough

        Now you should check out your nets preferably on a  daily
        basis, or at very least after two or three days.

 - fixed missing 'hideworker' store symbol

        Now it appears, but being a symbol of a hide - not  a fox
        like previously.

 - time required to find cover and hide decreased

 - fixed occasional problems with 'repeat previous combat option' 

 - lots of new truecolor and none 256-color images 

        All the 8-bit images are history. There's a big bunch  of
        new images including for example:
        * new 'character acting' images for  moving by watercraft, 
          setting a trap, making a  fire,  fishing,  working wood,
          tanning and curing hides, drying meat or fish.
        * new animal pictures of bear, hare, reindeer, snake
        * new terrain type images of village, field, lake,  river,
          rapids, mountain, cave, grove, forests, bogs etc.
        ...and more. 

 - current map view enchanched

        When on a zoom-map a small image of  the  current  terrain 
        type with a description will be shown above the actual map
        view. More versatile description and scale is shown  below
        the map view. Wilderness map view   remains  the  same  as 
        before.

 - savefile disk space comsumption reduced again just a little bit

	This shows only after exploring the world  for  some  time.
        Initial savefile size has actually increased.

 - character profile menu is now mouse sensitive

	
        Also 'Yes/No' attribute  reroll  selection  upon  character 
        creation can be selected by mouse click.

 - trading/chatting improved

	There's a whole new chat screen, which is  currently  used
        only in trading for goods or  animals  and  in  asking for 
	directions. However, all the  chat  options  are  selected
        from the new screen, but when choosing anything else  than
        'Ask for directions/Trade/Buy an animal' you will enter in
        the old chat-engine.

	* So, ask for directions option is active again and can be
          used to ask for location of villages, lakes and caves.

        * New trading system goes like this:
          NPC offers an item for a trade and if you are interested
          in it the trade will start. You can now choose and offer
          items from your inventory until the trade is complete.

          Trading will also  start  when  picking  up  items  from 
          stores - just like before. 

        * 'Buy an animal' chat option will  be  available  in  the
          chat option list only in the villages.

	New chat screen is also mouse sensitive.

 - new setup option: RESIZE QUALITY

	The  game  occasionally  resizes  certain  images.  RESIZE 
        QUALITY setup option can be set to LOW, MED, GOOD or HIGH.
        LOW is the worst quality but fastest way  to  do  it,  and 
        HIGH is naturally top quality but most slow. If occasional
        resizing feels slowish on your system, you can use this to
        speed things up a little bit.
        But resizing images actually doesn't happen often at all.

 - the world is now culture sensitive!

	This means, each region of the world now belongs  to  some
        culture - or in some cases there's no man's  land  between 
        settled regions.
        Yes! This is a big change, although not utilized very much 
        yet. But it's there now for future cultural  improvements.

 - villages improved

	Villages and settlements now have characteristics specific
        to which culture they belong in. Differences can  be  seen 
        in the size of  the  villages,  population,  building  and 
        store types. For example  Kaumolaiset  have  rather  small
        villages and  Driikiliset  have  bigger, almost town-like
        villages. Northern people do live in 'kota's -  which  are
        kind of tents made out of animal hides. You can expect  to
        find more fishing related stores  from  Islander  villages
        and so on. More changes will be added in  the  future  but
        there truly is now some effective cultural variety. 
          You can learn more about cultures and characteristics of
        their livelihood and villages from the game info-browser.

 - changes in zooming in nearby the shore

        When you zoom in nearby the shore and are  facing  towards
        the water  you  will  be  automatically located nearby the
        coastline on the zoom-map.

 - fixed occasional game-freezing when entering a village/crowded
   area

 - time required to go into shock and finally die from  bloodloss 
   has been doubled. This of course  applies  not  only  to  your 
   character but also to all the other creatures as well

 - fixed fast-spoilage bug which occured when  transporting  food
   (with a punt etc.) to an area not visited long time ago
  
 - fixed possibility to leash and steal animals from villages

 - fixed oddities in using skis

        Sometimes the game didn't correctly  recongnize  removing
	or putting on your skis.

 - wielding a weapon in a village  isn't  a  hostile  gesture  in 
   anymore

        This feature was removed because  of  causing  too   many
        unintentional conflicts.

 - fixed "go away" command not working

        It didn't work properly when you tried to command  people
        to get away from your area/settlement.

 - appearance of wandering animals slightly tuned

        Number of wandering animals on  the  wilderness  map  has
        been increased a bit. Their  moving  routines  have  also
        been enchanced. Now it should be easier to  find  animals
        and their tracks from the wilderness.  Nevertheless  it's
        still not too easy.

 - changes in TRACKING 

        Automatical follow of the tracks has  been  removed.  Now
        you have to always track and move,  and  track  and  move
        manually. You will also be notified wether the tracks you
        find  are   fresh   or  old,  so  remember  to  read  the
        information you get upon tracking carefully.

 - fixed bug in encounters on ice

        Even though you did   encounter  something  on  ice,  the
        creature never showed up on the zoom map. This  has  been
        fixed now.

 - changes  in   seeing  creatures  from  the  distance   on  the
   wilderness map

        Now you can spot them only if they are  on  a  relatively
        "open" landscape like  for  example  a  bog,  field  etc.
        Moreover, it  isn't  possible to spot small animals like
        squirrels, hares and such from a longer distance anymore.

 - fixed mobility meter oddities

        Now it should work. To clear things out,  since  mobility
        meter hasn't been too precisily documented in  the  game:
	100% mobility means that you are moving with your normal,
        unencumbered  walking   speed. (And  how  fast  that  is,
        actually depends on your Speed attribute)
        Carrying any load or being injured immediately drops  the
        mobility. If you are running your mobility can get  above
        100%.  Generally   running  will  double  your  effective
        mobility, and being down or  crawling halves it.
	Notice that total percentage of penalty from injuries and
        carried load is reduced from your physical skill  mastery
        as is, but the mobility is calculated a bit  differently.
        So don't get confused having 70% mobility with only  -12%
        total physical penalty or so.

 - added fallen/dead/sleeping avatars  for  Njerpez,  Stag,  Elk,
   Cattle and Bull

 - fixed wounds of animals and people   wandering  with  you  not
   healing

        They just didn't heal properly over time. Now they do.
 
 - fixed food packed on animals not spoiling

	This old exploit is now fixed.

 - added sex choice to character creation

	It's chosen after chosing culture. 

 - all the face portraits are now truecolor images

        Some old ones may have gone, and I think there  might  be
        at least one new portrait also. Portraits  to  be  chosen
        are related to the culture you choose.

 - caves are back

        And as result of this game-course tasks "Cave combat" and
        "Cave exploration" are now functional. Caves can be found
        by the mountains - but they are small ones, no multilevel
        dungeons. Most of the caves you find are  propably  empty
        but some may be inhabitated by a lynx or a  bear  or  so.
        And maybe you can sometimes find a lonely adventurer or a
        foreign warrior lodging there - or at least  somekind  of
        traces of past human visitors.

 - map structure complete overhaul
	  
        The game map, The  UnReal  World,  now  consists  of  one
        entire seamless area which is about  twice  as  large  as
        before. This is a  huge  improvement  which  affects  the
        whole gameplay and is the most significant  and  was  the
        most labourious improvement in this version 3.00.
          When moving on the zoom maps little loading takes place
        when you travel further away from  the  original  zoom-in
        location, but the principle of seamless maps  stays.  You
        can travel across the UnReal World in  the  zoom-in  mode
        if you like! As mentioned before this brings  some  whole
        new aspects to the gameplay.  You  can  chase  your  prey
        virtually forever, there's no border  it  can cross   and
        get away. Same rules of course apply  to  your  character
        also.
          [ENTER] is used to zoom in and out, like previously. 
        And you are allowed to zoom out back onto  the wilderness
        map when you're a reasonable  distance  away  from  other
        creatures.
          I wouldn't be surprised if the map  structure  overhaul
        has caused some weird bugs  since practically  everything
        in the game has something to do with the maps.  I had  to
        re-write a lots of code and have tried to  eliminate  the
        bugs the best I could  but if you still find some, please
        do report.
        * known bug:
          Party members and tame animals are prone to vanish upon
          campaign change, so maybe you should think  of a little
          slaughtering before changing campaign.

 - saved characters need A LOT more space than before

        Even an initial character creation eats  up  70  Mb's  of
        disk space and it keeps growing during gameplay. This  is
        not a feature :) but a result of map structure overhaul.

 - completely re-written random world generator!

        It's so much faster, better and more beautiful  that  you
        have to witness  it  by  yourself,  but  some  major  new
        features are:
        * You can choose  to  create  map  from  three  different
          regions of the world: Inland, Northern or Archipelago.
        These region types are quite  self-explanatory  and  give
        you an idea of what kind of landscape will result of each.
        * Option to save and load previously  generated  maps  is
          back.
        * Rivers. Yes. There are rivers.
        * World is  generated  fast  and the result is  beautiful
          and realistic.
        * Random world generator interface is mouse sensitive.
          Hotkeys work too.

 - game interface made more mouse sensitive here and there

        Many menus and lists are mouse sensitive now and you  can
        point and click the option you wish  to  select.  All the
        keyboard commands are still  functional  and  you  should
        keep in mind that the game is still  foremostly  keyboard
        based.
        Mouse sensitive  menus are best notified from  the  alpha
        blended bar  upon  current  selection.  Clicking  cursors
        keys  or moving the mouse causes the selection  to  move.
        Mouse-click, Enter or possible Hotkey-click then  selects
        the current option.

 - start menu is mouse-sensitive

        So loading and creating a character, setup  etc.  can  be
        gone thru by pointing and clicking.
        The game also now starts  immediately  after  loading  or
        creating a character  without  having  to  choose  "Play"
        option like before.
        Oh, and old pretty unnecessary setup  options  "fade  old
        notes" and "permanent map" have been removed.

 - "Choice menu" is mouse sensitive now

        That's the menu where you choose most of the game options
        like what to make, attack type, hit location, how to talk
        and many skill-related options etc.
        Hotkeys are still working also.

 - ritual screen improved and stylized
 
        * Added mouse sentivity. You  can  select  and  choose  a
          ritual by pointing and clicking it with mouse.
        * Info texts and button  locations  have  been   slightly
          modified.
        * Removed excess keypress previously needed  to  continue 
          when ritual screen pops up during character creation.

 - "Map of known areas" screen re-written

        Even though there is now a bigger world to memorize, this
        screen now runs faster than an escaping fox!
        There is also new option to toggle map markers ON or OFF,
        and since the whole map doesn't fit on one screen you can
        scroll  it   with  cursors  keys.  This  screen  is  also
        completely  mouse sensitive so you can either use hotkeys
        or point and click the buttons with mouse.

 - there are no more caves

        Yes. Caves  have  been  completely  removed. They  really
        didn't fit into  the  game  anymore.   Game-course  tasks
        haven't  been updated yet, so all the cave related  tasks
        do get accomplished automatically. Might be that somekind
        of small caves by the mountainsides will be  added  later
        on, but multi-level dungeons in the UnReal World are  now
        history.

 - little changes in start-up scenarios

        "Call of the cave" scenario has been removed  and  "Hurt,
        helpless and afraid" has been moved to take  its'  place.
        In the "Agriculture"  scenario   start-up   equipment now
        includes something new to plant: broad beans.

 - winter SURVIVAL command "make a hole in  the  ice"  works  now
   only on the zoom-map.

 - wrapped maps removed

        This was because of map structure overhaul.  Somekind  of
        maps may be added later on.
    
 - TRACKING-skill and wandering animal routines enchanced

        TRACKING-skill  now  only  tries  to  look  for  existing 
        tracks, it doesn't generate them like previously.  So  if
        you are a skilled tracker and just can't find tracks from
        a  certain  location, it's very likely that no animal has
        been there for some time.  So,  wandering  animals  don't
        just magically pop up from time anymore. They are set  to
        exists in  more  realistic way and once this is done they
        go about their lives and walk the earth as they please.
        Now  TRACKING-skill   is   also   occasionally    checked
        automatically as your  character  wanders  throught   the
        wilderness. This means if  you happen to walk  across elk
        tracks you have  chance  to  notice  them  even  if   not
        actively using the skill. During  the  wintertime  even a
        not so  experienced  tracker  should  be  able  to  quite
        easily spot some tracks only by roaming around. Of course
        this is not infallible and active use  of  TRACKING-skill
        has it's time in hunters life.

 - character creation process enchanched and stylized

        * Culture, season and portrait selection menus are  mouse
          sensitive now.
        * Visual appearance of the process has been  stylized  to 
          be more player friendly and informative.
        * Object and creature randomization is  comfortably  fast
          and thus executed automatically everytime.

 - flora overhaul

        ALL the mushrooms and wild edible plants and berries have
        been COMPLETELY re-arranged and re-written. This goes for
        their names, growing season and environment and so on.
        All of this is now more  realistic,  and  especially  the
        growing environment has come into play more.
        * Once more: All the mushrooms are new. And  like  before
          there  are  poisonous  ones,  not  so  poisonous  ones,
          deadly and now even psychoactive ones.
        * In addition to good old blueberries and such there  are
          now lots of new berries:
          lingonberry, cloudberry, northern bilberry, raspberry.
          All of which grow in their natural environment.
        * Unique individuals of plants, berries   and   mushrooms
          which can be harvested, ripen and mature  at  a  little
          bit different times, earlier or later  than  the  other
          individuals.
          Rarely some that ripen very early can even produce  two
          yields of harvest during their growing season.
        * Fruit/crops bearing flora now  appears as  a   plants -
          shrubs, brambles and bushes. There is now for example a
          blueberry shrub which can be harvested for blueberries.
          Harvesting is done like before, by trying  to  pick  up
          the plant. If the plant  bears  fruit/crops, harvesting
          will start and after some time you'll  be  informed  of 
          the results and the harvested crops are added to   your
          inventory. Time spent for  harvesting  depends  on  the
          plant. Some berries for example are more slow to gather
          than the others.

 - added terrain symbol variations and re-drawn old ones

        Basically this means there are few  different  tiles  for
        some trees, mountains  etc. This makes the  terrain  look
        better and more natural. Many of  the  old  symbols  have
        also been re-drawn.

 - procedure to go by waterways modified

        Now it goes like this:
        - have a punt or raft beside the coast-line
        - wield a sesta etc.
        - step on the punt/raft and  move  normally  towards  the
          water.
        This is a lot more smooth way than  previously.  (And  if
        you happen to do it in the old fashion  way  by  applying
        sesta, the game will inform you how things are now.)

 - added water depth

        The water is shallow nearby the coast  and   gets  deeper
        further  away.  This   currently  has  effect on the fish
        populations and fishing and moving  with sesta. You can't
        go too deep using sesta as it needs  to  touch  the  lake
        bottom.

 - added new item: Paddle

        Paddle is used to move  a  punt  or  a  raft  ahead. With
        paddle you can move thru deeper waters than  with  sesta.
        Paddle can  be  made  by  yourself.  It is located  under 
        "Wooden items" in the "Make" menu.

 - zoom terrain generation enchanched

        * Lakes  and  rivers  have  beautiful  curvy  coast-lines
          matching their wilderness map shape!
          Mountainous areas also have curvy edges. In general all
          the  zoom  maps  are  now  far  more   better  detailed
          generations  of the wilderness locations than before.
        * There are new trees:
          Rowan and Alder.
          And also young trees of already existing species:
          Young spruce and Young pine.
          Currently different trees don't have much of  different
          qualities or characteristics but  this  will  be  added 
          later on. Now it only looks very, very nice. One  thing
          is that young trees aren't visual obstructions, so  you
          can see but you can't walk thru them.
        * Pines, not young nor older, aren't visual  obstructions
          anymore so you can  see  easily  around  in  the   pine 
          forests. They still remain as obstacles of course.
        * Lots   of  terrain    generation  routines  have   been
          re-written to make the  zoom  maps   better   represent
          the characteristics of each landform type.
        * Added new map-symbol:
          Moss.
          Currently it has no other use than to serve as a little
          eye-candy at pine swamps.

 - hills, mountains and their height

        Mountains  are   not   obstacles   anymore.  Not  on  the
        wilderness map nor on the zoom-map. So you don't  have to
        climb the mountains anymore - just walk. It however takes
        more of game-time than walking thru flat  terrain.
        Then, terrain height has now a slight significance:
        When standing on  a  hill,  you  can  see  further  away.
        Actually only mountains are visual obstructions from  the
        hill-top.
        When standing on a mountain-top you can see as  far  as..
        well, as far as you can see..
        So hills and mountains can be used to scan  the  horizon.
        Currently it  doesn't  matter  wether you  really  are at
        the highest point of the  mountain  or  hill.  Hills  and
        mountain tiles of different height will  be  added  later 
        on - but this is a start.

 - slight modifications in getting slender tree trunks

        All the young trees will make slender tree   trunk   when
        fallen down. Falling down  a  slender  tree  (rowans  and
        alders) is now a bit faster, but you get only  one  trunk
        from one tree.

 - minor animal dangerousness modifications

        Lynx and badger made less dangerous.
        Bear made more dangerous.
                                             
 - fishing skill/procedure enchanched 

        First of all: fishing is now solely a zoom-map skill.
        Upon using FISHING-skill a  sub-menu  with  three options 
        will open. There are options for active fishing,  setting
        and pulling the net up. When  selecting   active  fishing
        you'll be asked to select your fishing  equipment.  After
        selecting  good   old   fishing rod, a club or a spear an 
        appropriate fishing method is started just like before.
        Biggest changes are in net-fishing. From now on nets need
        to be set into the deep water. So it's  not  possible  to 
        set them from the coast anymore.
        There's also this separate sub-menu command  for  pulling
        the net up.  Picking them up in with [;] command  doesn't
        work anymore.
        After setting the net  on  the  zoom-map  a  marker  will 
        appear on the wilderness map to  show  you  the  location
        where the net was  set. This  helps,  or  makes  it  even
        possible, to find the net afterwards.

 - fish populations and catch enchanced and made more realistic

        All the fish now have attributes  for  their  environment
        and habitat, time  of activity, how rare or  common  they
        are in The UnReal World etc. This brings the  fishing  to
        the new level. Your catch  is  determided  by  all  these
        factors.
        The fish can have habitats like shallow  or  deep  water,
        river or rapids. They can be active for example early  in
        the morning and late in the evening. Some can  be  caught
        by net, some can't etc.
        The fish species remain the same as before.
        Few spoilers: perch is the most common fish in the UnReal
        World. It lives in lakes, not too deep, and  is   usually
        looking for food in the morning and in the  evening. 
        And if you are  after  those  big   delicious  trouts  or
        salmons you'd better head  to  the  rivers.  Having  some
        rapids in that river won't harm at  all.  But  there  are
        also trouts living in the lakes here and there.

 - growing flora has their own symbols

        All the growing plants, mushrooms, berries and so on have
        their own symbols which look a bit like  the  adult/ready
        plant but are  smaller, or just appear as a twig or shrub
        without berries etc.
        Some plant symbols have been re-drawn, for example turnip
        which is now reddish like this old turnip breed has been.
    
 - sounds are panned relative to your characters location/direction

        The sounds your character hears during  the  game already
        have loudness relative to the distance from you. Now  the
        sounds are  also  panned  relative  to  your  character's
        location and direction he/she is  facing.
        For example:
        S = something that makes sound, @ = your character

        S..
        ...
        .@.
        ...

        If your character is facing directly to north you'll hear
        the  sound  slightly  from  the  left.  If your character
        is facing towards the sound then  you will naturally hear
        it  from  the  center.  And  if  your character is facing
        to south you'll  hear the sound  slightly from the right.
        "Heading" screen also  still  shows  the  sound  location
        visually but now you can also find your way to the source
        of the sound just by listening carefully.

 - added lots of new musics

        Intro  and  "character  death"  tunes  are  performed  by
        FM2000. "Armour coverage" and Outro (game end)  tunes are
        performed by Armas Huutamo (author actually plays in  the
        band).
        Rest of the musics are from the  Primimitive  music  from
        Finland: Home-coming ritual  CD  which  is  made  by  UrW
        authors and is available and for sale at  the  game  home
        page.
        FM2000 and Armas Huutamo CDs  are  available for  example
        from Lahna Records: www.lahnarecords.fi
        Feel free to support the bands by buying  their  records,
        especially if the music hits you. You  can  also  contact
        the author for more info about international orders since
        there many different possibilities.

 - lying/dead bear has it's own sprite

        This is added just for starters. Later on all the animals
        and humans get their own lying/dead sprite. So prepare to
        see a collapsed bear instead of upside-down bear.

 - symptoms of diseases/diet improved

        There are many more ailments than before: nausea, stomach
        ache, slight and severe poisonings etc.
        And some mushrooms for example are deadly or cause severe
        poisoning only  in  large  dosages.  Small  dosages maybe
        causing only nausea. Symptoms can also appear  only after
        few hours, sometimes after few days, from ingestion.
        And like before in case of mushrooms: some must be boiled
        before eating, and for some even the boiling can't remove
        the poison completely.
        One new feature you should remember is   that  eating raw
        fish or raw meat isn't good for your stomach.

 - storehouses actively restock their supplies

        New stuff did occasionally appear at storehouses  in  the
        past too, but this was dependent on the  NPCs  really  to
        walk in and leave something they didn't need. In addition
        to this, storehouses  now  also  actively  restock  their
        supplies if they are running  out.  Notice  that  in  the
        UnReal World this doesn't magically happen overnight.  It
        takes days,  sometimes  even  weeks  for  the  storehouse
        owners to overcome serious  shortage of supplies, but now
        it really actually works!

 - passing out because of pain/shock modified

        Possibility to pass out from getting wounded to limbs  or
        other non vital areas  has  been  reduced  significantly.
        Only few pain sensitive limb  areas remain.  For  example
        foot and elbow, but the effective impact required to make
        the character pass out from this kind of wounds has to be
        a lot more  severe  than   previously. Notice  that  this
        modification applies to non-player characters also, since
        combat rules are identical for the both  parties  of  the
        battle.

 - regional events re-written/modified

        This was because of map-structure overhaul.  Njerpez raid
        and forest fire events needed most of new code,  so  they
        carry the highest bug possibility.
        Avalanche and settler events have been completely removed.

 - regional knowledge of non-player characters  is  temporarily a
   plain zero

        Because of map structure overhaul NPCs don't  temporarily
        know anything about their surroundings. Re-writing all of
        this would have delayed release of this version too long,
        so I decided to do it later  on.  And  especially  as the
        whole communication system is going to be improved soon.

 - some game-course tasks removed (= made automatically accomplished)

        Few  game-course tasks  that  were  related  to  old  map
        structures and caves do get  accomplished  automatically.
        Later on new tasks will be added to replace  these  ones.
        Automatically accomplished task are for example:
        "Moving on", , "Secrets  of  the  mountains",
        "Cave combat" and "Down we go".

 - small islands are safe from encounters

        Wandering animals don't appear on  small islands anymore.

 - added new plant: broad bean

        This brings a little more variation to  the  fields,  and 
        you can grow your own broad beans too.  In  this  version
        Broad beans can be eaten raw, but recipes will  be  added
        later on.

 - added new truecolor images

        * background picture for armour coverage screen
        * all four game-course title pictures
        * elk, stag, fox, artic fox, lynx, wolf, squirrel
          game-info pictures
        * big avatars: moving by watercraft, falling a tree.
          Also almost all of the  old  avatar  pictures  are  now
          truecolor ones.

 - summon the giant pike ritual removed

        For most of the players it was too much of a high-fantasy
        thing thus removed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
version: 2.92
released: Aug-06-2006

*** NOTICE! Saved characters from the previous versions are NOT compatible ***
***         with this version.                                             ***

 - fixed raining at the wintertime

        Now it snows. Horizon window still has the same rain symbol
        but blue raindrops are replaced by white snow-pixels.

 - added notifications of cooked food getting ready or burned

        This applies to recipes where  the  food  is  left  to  be
        prepared and character's presence isn't needed -  that  is
        currently roasted meat and fish.
        Character will smell when the food is ready and when  it's
        going  to  burn  soon.  Your  character  will  smell  this
        practically every time, but exceptions CAN happen.

 - fixed odd food spoiling

        This happened in various circumstances:
        After spoiling some food by burning it and  then  handling
        not spoiled food. Or sometimes when using cellar etc.
        Hopefully it's fixed for good now.

 - using newest SDL version at the moment

        SDL version 1.2.11
        unmodified

 - using newest SDL mixer version at the moment

        SDL_mixer version 1.2.7
        unmodified

 - few internal graphic routines re-written

        Theses are mostly things you can't  see  except  for  the
        real working floodfill-routine. Just check out the armour
        screen. Body areas  are  completely  coloured -  the  old
        floodfill routine was too stupid to do that.

 - new true colour background pictures

        * Religious/supernatural profile background picture.
          It's really supernatural. I like it!
        * Armour coverage background picture is the same old one
          but a true color version.
        * Wounds & injuries background picture is a new one, but
          familiar from the start-up screen.

 - fixed "I don't see you - you don't see mee" kind of hiding

        Previously you could easily sneak beside your target when
        looking away from it. When you didn't see your target, it
        couldn't see you either. Now this  is  fixed  and  it  is
        actually very important to maintain visual connection  to
        your target especially when you are getting near to it.

 - [t]hrow command improved

        When you have both hand  in use,  primary  and  secondary
        weapon wielded, the command work as  previously -  you'll
        be asked which one to throw.
        But when you have at least one free hand you'll  be  able
        to choose directly from your inventory what to throw.
        This means you can shoot with your bow, when you have  it
        wielded, just by using [t]hrow command. No need to  wield
        arrows like before.
        This makes it also few keypresses easier to  for  example
        throw firewood into the fireplace etc. 

 - avatar revolution

        Both character and fellow creature avatars are under  big
        construction which brings up many possibilities  to  make
        avatars more lively in the future. This is  what  new  we
        have so far:
        * There's now female character avatar.
        * Stag and elk have different avatars.Stag is pretty much
          like the old one. Elk is slightly smaller  and  doesn't
          have antlers.
        * Added own avatar for squirrel
        * Many creatures have now little animation
        * Added a color variation for cattle, bull and dog

 - achery (and missile attack) improved

        * If you are shooting unaware target, a creature which  is
          sleeping or one which can't see you, and  miss  a  shot,
          creatures will still react to the sound  of  the   arrow
          and if they are  awake  they  may  spot  you.   Sleeping
          animals tend to wake up but not necessarily notice   you
          at first.
        * Human opponents respect the bow and arrow.
          That means if  you  are   getting  many  shots  to  them
          without them getting to close  combat  range  they  tend
          to escape and take  some   distance  for  some  time  to
          protect their skin.
        * Animals don't actively dodge arrows or  thrown  weapons.
          So they are easier targets compared  to humans who  are
          aware of your intentions.
        * Added size modifier for both archery and thrown weapons.
          Creatures noticeable larger than humans are now slightly
          easier to hit. On the other hand  you'll  get  a  little
          penalty for  trying  to  hit smaller animals.
          So shoot close when you are after squirrels.
        * It has always been easier to hit from the close distance
          and now that has been modified slightly even more  easy.
          So bows are more accurate.  Long  distance  shots  still
          need great skill or good luck.
        * Arrows can break when hitting the target.
          Hit to a hard target, like a tree  or   rock,  is  very
          likely to break your arrow. Hit  to  a soft  target  or 
          creature will also sometimes break the arrow.

 - stupid aggressive creature moves removed

        Ever met an aggressive creature who just runs around while
        your character is scoring nice hits? Me too. That kind  of
        not-so-wise combat behaviour should be removed now.

 - fixed possibility to drop negative number of items

 - default install directory changed to "UnRealWorld" instead
   of "UnReal_World"
         
 - added two new bird sounds

 - added just a tiny possibility to use mouse 

        It's possible to use mouse to choose a target in shooting,
        throwing and checking out a distant location etc.  This is
        kind of testing, so report back if it doesn't work. 
        Good old arrow keys are still working.
        Left mouse button also works as ENTER key everywhere in the 
        game.

 - added ambient and moving sounds

        As you walk, crawl, run or row  your  punt  you'll  hear  a 
        corresponding moving sound.
        Now there is also ambient sounds in the background all  the
        time. These include basic humming  of  the wilderness, wind
        and rain. There are on/off config options for  both  moving
        and ambient sounds if you like the silence better.

 - characters will endure freezing weather a little bit better than
   previously

 - added wintertime bonus for furs produced

         All the furs produced  during  wintertime  will  be   more 
         valuable than those produced during other seasons. This is
         because the animals have thicker fur at the wintertime.
         The value difference is not shown within the item name yet
         but you'll notice the difference when trading.

VERSION 2.91 URW.EXE FIX I
--------------------------
May-15-2006

-- fixed random crashing which occured especially in villages.

-- hides disappearing when trying to tan them fixed.

-- food continuing to roast after picking them up fixed.

-- game not recognizing completing "make roasted meat" task fixed.

-- food not roasting while sleeping fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version: 2.91
released: May-12-2006

*** NOTICE! Saved characters from the previous versions are NOT compatible ***
***         with this version.                                             ***
*** Data structures have been  changed also, so if you are using some      ***
*** editors don't expect them to work either.                              ***

 - fullscreen initialization options

        Instead of just choosing fullscreen mode ON or OFF there's
        now to alternative methods initialization methods: ON1 and
        ON2. If you can't get the game running in fullscreen  mode
        by just choosing ON you can try ON1 or ON2.  I'd  like  to
        receive reports if these options do any good for those few
        who haven't  gotten  the  game  work  in  fullscreen  mode
        previously.  Removing   SETUP.URW   file   from  your  UrW
        will reset the settings if the game fails to  start  after
        mode changes.

 - internal game data structure improved

        This is something the players won't notice,  but  it  will
        start affecting the game in the future. This is linked  to
        having better  organization  of  information  about  items
        being prepared. 
        Now you  can  see  amount  of  dried  or  smoked  food  in
        preparation AND cooking has improved a bit... (see below)

 - cooking of few recipes improved

        You don't have to sit still while preparing  roasted  fish
        or roasted meat. Now you leave them by  the  fire  to  get
        roasted and  can  move  and  work  while  they  are  being
        prepared.
        More recipes will be changed to  work  like  this  in  the
        future.

 - character directory removal after death

        Fixed - I think. Although it has worked in my system  for
        a long time so can't be 100% sure.

 - little more animation

        Other creatures move a little more while they are  active
        (not sleeping etc.) and you own avatar also  when  he/she
        is doing some tasks.


 - exhaustion behaviour improved

        When character gets really tired from  not  sleeping  the
        fatigue meter will start to grow. At some  point  fatigue
        prevents  the  character  from  walking   without   small
        resting periods. If exhaustion keeps continuing character
        finally starts to fall down and  fall  asleep.  At  first
        sleep is light  but  finally,  after  severe  exhaustion,
        turns into unconscious one making it possible to die from
        coldness, thirst or attacks during sleep. It's much  more
        realistic now. Not possible to keep crawling  around  for
        days without sleeping anymore.

 - graphical improvements

        Hey, aren't there few true color images in the game  now?
        Yes! Start-up and  character  creation  screens  and  few
        other are now true color ones. And more is to come.

 - new sounds

        fall,  shooting  with  a bow,  timberwork,  horse guffaw,
        reindeer and elk  coughing  and  bawling  sounds,  corpse
        skinning and cutting sounds, whimpering (small  animals),
        snuffle, new roar variation, snorting and grunting sounds
        (pigs and  bears),  water  sounds, few  birds  as  nature
        sounds, good old "harr"-sound when encountering something
        is also back, tree falling down sounds, running sound for
        escaping animals, burp  sound,  eating  sound  (which  is
        original), thumps and cracks and block sounds for combat,
        player gets hit sounds (these are  original  also), death
        scream, and three variations of ritual performing chants!

 - added just a little of touch of 3D to nature sounds

        Nature sounds come randomly  panned  and   with   varying
        volumes to give a nice little feeling of space.
        True origin of sound related panning will be added later.

 - colors fixed from map generation screen

        Colors of villages and  some  forest  areas  were  buggy.
        That's fixed now.

 - new musics
        
        Dramatical heavy drum beat added  to  armour  and  wound
        screens.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
URW.EXE fix II
--------------
Mar-26-2006

-- added full-screen mode and setup option for it

   This option is enabled from the setup. By default the game starts
   in a windowed mode, but if you prefer full-screen then just toggle
   it on from the setup, start the game again and it should run in a
   full-screen mode.
   If it doesn't, report to me, and play in a windowed mode.
   Deleting file SETUP.URW will restore setup defaults, if you fail
   to do it manually.

-- added setup option to turn background music on/off

-- fixed trading bug

   This is a victory! It was quite totally messed up, but should work
   with no problems now.

-- fixed pressing-shift-key-alone-clears-the-previous-attack-buffer bug

-- wound screen: fixed wounds being drawn "outside" of the body

-- fixed year-number-not-increasing bug

-- keyboard correspondence fixed:

   numpad zero (0) and period (,) are working now.

URW.EXE fix I
-------------
Jan-25-2006

-- fixed memory leaks

   There were many of them in addition to reported armours / wounds screens.
   Report if you find more.

-- horizon statistics screen is updated while sleeping so you see sun and moon traveling quickly accross the sky

-- pageup, pagedown, home & end keys didn't work except the ones in the numpad. Now they do work.

-- ritual performance screen wasn't showing. Now it is.

-- clock ticking while doing tasks was too slow. Now it's faster.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version: 2.90B
released: Jan-20-2006

*** This is the first Windows release of UrW ever. So, the game is very likely ***
*** more buggy than the previous versions ever were. There are really not many ***
*** new features that a player would notice - the game just has been ported to ***
*** Windows environment.  						       ***
*** From this version on the evolution of Windows UrW is just about to start.  ***
*** The game actually lacks some of the features of older versions. (See list  ***
*** below)                                                                     ***
*** Please do report especially the new bugs you find. After a relatively      ***
*** stable Windows version has been released, new game features will be added. ***

 What's "new" or has been removed/changed:

 - when creating a character object creation part has gone slow. 
   You'll see numbers running during this process.

 - the game doesn't run in full screen, but in 800*600 sized window.

 - take a screenshot [F10] doesn't work

 - loading of maps into rndworld generator doesn't work.

 - occasional problems to remove directory of dead character.

       Some very rare reported problems in this matter.
       If directories aren't removed correctly you can do it manually.
 
 - screen and colors and stuff:

       There are no screen fades in/out. 

 - sounds & music:

       All the music and sound effects from the old version are forgotten
       and gone forever. They were of low quality. UrW will be having completely
       new and a lot better set of music and sound effects in the future.
       For now there are just a few sounds effects and even less music.
       This is what we have currently:
       - monotonic shaman drum beats and one rythm in start-up, character 
         creation and death/quit background music
       - few animals sounds: cow, sheep, dog, plus few growls and roars
       - water (when swimming etc.), opening and closing door sound
       - start-up menu selection sound
       - wolf howl and owl (as a night time sound)
       - few battle sounds

       What is new already in current sound effects interface is the fact
       that there are few variations for sound effects. I try to keep it
       that way when adding more sounds. You will also hear from the sound
       volume how far the cause of the sound is from you. This doesn't apply
       to wilderness map. 

 - map item limit of 200 pieces:

       I think I removed it! Hopefully.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version: 2.80
released: May-24-2004

*** NOTICE! Saved characters from the previous versions are NOT compatible ***
***         with this version.                                             ***

 - fixed tons of bugs.

       ...just to mention couple of:

       * Fixed "the easy women"-bug.
         You can't no more get a  wife  just  by  saying   one
         carefully chosen sentence.
       * In making items water skin no longer work  as  "skin"
         of an animal.
       * You can go ashore on a map location with  a  shelter.
         This was previously impossible.
       * In addition to a maximum number of  items  a  certain
         animal can carry there's also limit in weight now.
         You can't pack logs on a sheep no more etc.
       * Item symbol of fish foods prepared  is  now  fish,
         previously it was a "ham" symbol.
       * You can cancel your attack at any phase; in choosing
         enemy, aspect or location.

 - people do respect the fences
         
       Only aggressive or escaping people now climb  over  the
       fences. So now you can protect your home  and  property
       a little bit better by enclosing it by a fence.

 - new graphics

       * added new startup screen
       * added couple of new character faces for each culture.
         These include  couple  of  portraits  that  some  UrW
         playrs have  sent  to  me.  Hopefully   the   persons
         concerned will recognize themselves.
       * new "hiding" and "shooting with a bow" small pictures

 - added some animation

       The animation is very little and there's not so much of
       it yet, but  now  that these routines have  been  coded
       more is to come.
       Now you can see animation in:
       * waves and fire.
       * some creatures as they peacefully move about:
         cattles, bulls, dogs, snakes, sheeps,
         shopkeepers, women

 - vegetable kingdom is associated with turning of seasons

       All the plants, berries, mushrooms, vegetables and  so
       on, are associated with turning of seasons. They start
       to grow in the spring and if not  harvested  will  die
       in the late autumn. Now the vegetarian food  you  find
       from the wilderness may be ready to be  picked  up  or
       still growing. If you happen to find an area with lots
       of vegetarian food in a growing  phase  you  can  come
       back  after   a  while  and  find  them  ready  to  be
       harvested. Also the  plants  you  leave  untouched  in
       the autumn will die when the cold  weathers  come  but
       start growing again in the next spring. The area   you
       completely harvest  won't  propably  have  new  plants
       growing in the next spring.

 - change in FORAGING-skill

       The skill only makes you find young, growing plants.
       Plants that are ready to  be  harvested  you  should
       find and notice by walking around the current area.

 - added new skill: AGRICULTURE

       Yes, it is now possible to grow some  crops!  Use  the
       skill when  you  posses  some  appropriate  plants  or
       seeds.
       Generally you should plant your crops  in  the  spring
       and harvest them in  the  autumn.  The  growing season
       is between those two seasons. Some  plants  and  crops
       need more time to grow than the others, and some  need
       to be planted earlier than the others because of their
       sensitivity to cold  weather. It's  also  possible  to
       plant or sow something in the late autumn for the next
       year. Even if the plants wouldn't have time  to make a
       harvest that year they can pass the  winter  and start
       growing again in the next spring.
       The plants/seeds you are going to plant or sow have to
       be healthy, not spoiled. You may want to start looking
       for these early in the spring because finding  them is
       not always easy. Currently it  is  possible  to  plant
       turnips (from turnip seeds) and peas (from fistful  of
       peas)
       You'll learn more by trying the skill out and  reading
       about it from the game info browser.
       There are two agriculture options:
       - Prepare the soil
       - Plant/sow something
       When you have selected a place where you wish to  grow
       something first you have to make the woodland  fertile
       with a burn over procedure. Fall down some  trees  and
       set them on fire. When the fire has burnt out and  the
       remainding of the fire are left use "Prepare the soil"
       option. The soil at the certain location will  be  now
       prepared for you  to  plant/sow  something. Burn  over
       and prepare the soil until you satisfied with size  of
       your agricultural area. After this you  need  to  wait
       until the ground has cooled down. Remainding  of  fire
       will disappear and prepared soil can be seen. Now  you
       can use "Plant/sow something" option.

 - added new item

       * Turnip seeds - with these  you  can  grow  your  own
         turnips

 - you have to set the fire burning in fireplaces

       There is no longer everlasting  fire  burning  in  the
       fireplaces. You'll have to set  the  fire  burning  by
       using SURVIVAL-skill. The procedure is the same as  in
       building up a normal campfire.  First  wield and throw
       enough firewood into the fireplace. Then  use SURVIVAL
       skill to get the fire burning. Once the fireplace  has
       been heated up it stays warm for a long time. You  can
       warm yourself beside it or cook  something  after  the
       actual fire  has  burnt  out.  This  is  advantage  of
       fireplaces compared to a normal campfile.
       Now, if the weather is cold, you'll have  to  remember
       to warm up your  house  before  it' s  comfortable for
       example to go to sleep.
       Also sauna stove must be  heated  up  before  there is
       use to throw water on it by applying the sauna scoop.
       Fireplaces are  now  also  used  in  cookery.  Certain
       recipes can be prepared only in the heated  fireplace.

 - recipe categories re-arranged

       Recipe categories for cookery are now as follows:

       Meat recipes
       Fish recipes
       Soups and drinks
       Vegetarian recipes
       Additional

       Some recipes have been  moved into  another  category.
       For example "Fish soup"  has  been  moved  from "Fish
       recipes" to "Soups and drinks"

 - changes in some recipes

       * "Flat rye bread" recipe
         Flat rye bread now needs  to  be prepared in  heated
         fireplace. Previously normal campfire was required.
       * "Smoked meat" recipe
         Smoked meat needs to  be  prepared  indoors  with  a
         a recently  heated  fireplace.  It  takes  couple of
         weeks before the meat is ready.

 - new cookery recipes

        * two turnip recipes: stewed turnip & boiled turnip
          (under "Vegetarian recipes" category.
        * pea soup
          (under "Soups and drinks" category)
        * dried meat
          (under "Meat recipes" category)
          It's possible to prepare dried meat only  when  the
          weather is cold and dry enough. That  is  from  the
          beginning of the winter till the spring. Dired meat
          is prepared by hanging cuts of  meat  on  the  wall
          outside of some building. Then  the  meat  is  left
          there for at least month. This  is  worth  of   the
          trouble because  dried meat  keeps  good  virtually
          forever.
        * dried fish
          (under "Fish recipes" category)
          The procedure is the same as in making  dried meat.
          It takes a little less time to dry fish. Dried fish
          also keeps good for a very long time.

 - cellars added

       Cellars   are  for  preserving  food  and   especially
       vegetables. Bread, meat or fish stored into the cellar
       also keeps good significantly  longer  but  vegetables
       can be preserved in cellars  from autumn till the next
       spring.
       Cellars  are large  pits  dug  into  the   ground  and
       strengthened and packed up with  slender  tree  trunks
       and rocks.
       It is possible to  build  your  own  cellar  by  using
       [M]ake-command and [B]uildings & Misc-category.
       To store something into the cellar  just  walk  on  it
       and [d]rop the food you wish to store.
       To get something from the cellar walk on  it  and  use
       [,] pick command or use [:] command to check out  what
       is in the cellar.

 - wives do not fight beside you anymore

       Now wives only watch helplessly as you  enter  into  a
       fierce battle or someone attacks  you.  This  prevents
       them from doing any foolish, like  attacking  superior
       enemy, while you are away.  You  should  protect  your
       wife, not the vice versa.

 - new chat option: "Command"

       There's a new  chat  option  "Command".  Now  you  can
       command your party members, wife and other  people  to
       do something for you.  Not  everyone  will  obey  your
       every command though. This chat option can be executed
       from the further distance than the usual chat options.
       Commands are:
       * "Wait a moment"
         You can command someone to stand still for a moment.
         They'll continue moving about after a while. This is
         useful if you have something to say to  someone  who
         is just about to walk away, behind a house etc.  and
         you are afraid you'll loose him.
       * "Wait here"
         This commands someone to stand still until you  give
         him/her a permission to move again. This way you can
         keep your companions out of trouble and prevent them
         from going somewhere  you  don't want  them  to  go,
         for example not to rush into the fight. If you leave
         the area your companions will start  to  follow  you
         again again. So you still need to use "Greet" option
         to tell your wife to wait until you come  back  from
         the longer journeys.
       * "You can move about now"
         This gives someone a permission to move again.
       * "Go away!"
         Used to the people to  leave  your territory or home
         immediately.

 - two new start-up scenarios: "AGRICULTURE" and "HURT, HELPLESS, AND AFRAID"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version: 2.70
released: Dec-14-2002

*** NOTICE! Saved characters from the previous versions are NOT compatible ***
***         with this version.                                             ***

 - some bugs fixed - as always.

       Hopefully I fixed something that made YOU to use a bad language. 

 - there's no longer need to be afraid of angry dogs in the villages.

 - trap-pits can be filled again (and therefore removed) by using
   a shovel.

 - animals can be milked only once a day.

 - bloodscapes and remaindings of fire will eventually fade away
   in a couple of days.
    
 - you don't learn rituals straight away anymore.

       You will be notified when you are about to learn a
       new ritual. The ritual will appear in  the  ritual
       menu, but before you can use it you must  talk  to
       some wise man or a sage to learn the correct words
       and manners to perform the ritual.

 - shelters you build are marked on the wilderness-scale map
   and on the 'Map of known areas'(F6)

 - added new item to make: stone-axe

 - bloodthirst of small carnivores (fox, ermine etc.) reduced.

       They still can hurt you so bad that  you  lose your
       consciousness but they don't  (on  purpose)  try to
       finish you after you've passed away.

 - maximum amount of meat to be cooked at once recuded from 40 to 20 pieces

 - Oatmeal is now called porridge

 - added new item: Bag of rye-flour

       In the villages bags of rye-flour can be found from
       granaries and food  storehouses.  Rye-flour  can be
       used to bake bread and cook porridge.

 - added 3 new cookery recipes: smoked meat, porridge & flat rye bread

       Smoked meat must be prepared indoors, preferably at
       sauna. After you've hung up  the  meat  nearby  the
       fireplace to get  it  smoked  and  dried  it  takes
       several days before it's  ready.
       Notice: when you come to get the smoked  meat  they
       are picked up one-by-one, not in a stack.  This  is
       because of internal structure of the game - so dont
       send a bug report about this :)
          For cooking porridge you  need flour. A porridge
       made this way is rather rough and takes  some  time
       to cook, but the recipe is easy and as we all  know
       porridge is a good breakfast.
          Flat rye bread  is  a  simple  bread  made  from
       rye-flour and water.

 - people in the villages now really defend each other.

       When attacking a single villager you can now expect
       to have virtually everyone in the village to attack
       you.

 - you don't no more get charged of assault when people walk into
   your traps.

       Previously  you   could  get  charged  of  criminal
       activity  even  if  your  trap was honestly set for
       wild animals.

 - people have some new stories and matters on their mind.

       Thanks for these go to Johannes Leino. Have a  nice
       chatting!

 - added possibility to get a wife.

       It's hard to give any tips within the  field  love,
       but there are some general guidelines.
       * Only Maidens are good wife candidates. 
       * It takes some time to  get  her  interested.  You
         must be a known person in the village where  your
         sweetheart lives,  so  remember  to  visit  there
         pretty often.
       * It all starts by talking with a girl. You can ask
         her some directions or anything at  all  to  make
         a contact. After you get to know each other a bit
         you can occasionally greet her or have  a  little
         chat with no particular reason. You know...
       * You'll notice when the girl gets interested.
       * Women love gifts, so be sure  to  give   valuable
         items to your sweetheart. (There's finally a good
         use for anklets and necklaces) You propably  know
         that  women like   expensive  furs  and beautiful
         clothes more than weapons and tools.
       * Talk to the girl a lot,  leave  the  village  and
         come back after a while, let  her  miss  you  for
         awhile, then return and surprise her with a  gift
         and so on...
         Do this for days, weeks or months -  whatever  it
         takes. Patience is  good.  If  you  think  things
         aren't going fast enough you may try to give  her
         more and more gits. Listen to her -  you'll  then
         know where you are going.
       So what's so special about  a wife  then?  If  love
       doesn't count there's still something left;
       If  you are wounded or suffer from a disease, every
       night slept with your  beloved  one  improves  your
       healing rate. So it's a good idea to  come home  to
       rest with your wife if you've got hurt  during your
       adventures.
         Cookery made with your wife is twice as fast  as
       alone and you'll make better meals  too.  So  it's
       very reasonable  to come home to your wife  afer a
       succesfull hunt, and prepare the prey together.
          Wife can be told to stay at the certain place.
       Usual procedure is to tell your wife to wait  for
       you, at your cottage for example,  when   you  go
       hunting or on a dangerous expedition. Chat option
       'Greet' is used to tell your wife to  stay  where
       you are or to walk with you.
          After you've got  yourself  a  wife  your  main
       objective as a man is to  keep  her  fed.  If  you
       leave her alone without food for a long  time  you
       can be sure she'll be gone when you come back.  So
       always remember to give her enough food  when  you
       are going away for days.
          
 - required time to dig or fill a trap-pit increased.

       As I've been correctly reminded it takes more like
       hours than fifteen minutes  to  dig  a  reasonable
       size  pit, so digging or filling a  trap  pit  now
       takes about 1-2 hours.

 - wild animals avoid big parties (and big numbers of other animals)

       This means you have to leave your house if   there
       are lots of animals around  and  you  are  after a
       game. Also if you have encountered pack of animals
       it's  not  likely  that  something  else  will  be
       encountered at the  very  same  area  as  long  as
       there's quiet and peaceful again.

 - you can't light torches and lanters just like that anymore.

       If there's no fireplace around you first  have  to
       make a fire, stand beside it and only then [a]pply
       torch or a lantern in order to light  it. You  can
       also use already burning torch  to  light  up  the
       next one.
           Torches also last a bit less than in  previous
       version.

 - you can tell other people to go away from your area.

       "Go away" or "This is my area" are  good  ways  to
       express yourself in this  matter.  People  usually
       escape in a hurry.
          Of course you  must  have  something  built  or
       at least have a building site around before anyone
       believes that the area they are at is your home.

 - some improvements in trap routines.

       Animals that are light in weight (hares, foxes etc.)
       can walk over trap pits with no harm.
          Amount of injury of trap-pit with pointed poles
       reduced. One can now survive  from  dropping  into
       a trap like this but still surely gets badly hurt.
          Leashed animals and your companions  don't  get
       caught into your own traps.

 - skills of your character will improve a little bit faster now.

 - food left in the snow now keeps good forever  if  it's
   cold enough. If  temperature  is  only  slightly below
   zero the food may still get spoiled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version: 2.60
released: Dec-17-2001

*** NOTICE! Saved characters from the previous versions are NOT compatible ***
***         with this version.                                             ***

 - encountered creatures won't stay on the zoom map area forever.

       They'll eventually go about their lives and move on
       if there's nothing too interesting at the area.  So
       the lonely settler doesn't have to watch a flock of
       reindeers and group of hunters arriving and staying
       at his backyard anymore.

 - pick-axes and boulders removed.

 - added new map symbol: big stone.

 - savefiles slightly organized.

       They still are fragmented and take some  space  but
       not as much as previously.

 - heavy and slow object maintenance routine removed.

       Hooray!

 - buildings improved.

       You don't no longer 'enter'  into  a  building  and
       'exit' back to open air. Rather buildings are fixed
       part of the current map.

 - saunas improved.

       Only now they really are like saunas; just a stove,
       bench, tub of water and a scoop.  Saunas also can't
       be recognized as saunas on the outside anymore. And
       nothing prevents you from living in a sauna or vice
       versa.

 - do-it-yourself buildings improved.

       Type of the building is  selected  beforehand  when
       making the groundwork. There is a different kind of
       groundwork option for each building type.
          Now it's also possible to build a storehouse. So
       go on building your home and courtyard  better  and
       more beautiful than ever.

 - clothes and armours heavily improved.

       * Quilt and  quirboul  armours  have been removed.
       * Added new materials for clothing: linen, nettle,
         wool  and  birch-bark.  More  information  about
         these can be obtained by using the game info
         browser.
       * Added lots of new clothes.
       * People now wear clothes more correctly according
         to their sex, wealth and status. Their ensembles
         also are historically more correct and realistic.
       All in all clothes and materials now  better  (and
       very well!) fit into the world of the game.

 - inventory screen and "more info"-notification:

       A notification about more information in inventory
       screen is now launched only when  there  really is
       more information available.
       
 - inventory commands (eat, wear, take off etc.) improved:

       All the old key commands work just fine but now it
       is also possible to change the  inventory  command
       from the inventory screen. Inventory  screen  will
       also show up until you return to game by  pressing
       [ESC]. So it's more convenient to for example drop
       or wear or eat several items in a row.

 - some creatures can be seen on the wilderness map.

       You can now spot figures of big creatures  on  the
       open areas of wilderness map. You may see  an  elk
       swimming in the lake or a bear walking accros  the
       swamp. This requires a  good  visibility  or  open
       area. I.e. in the forest creatures still can't  be
       seen.

 - human behaviour (heh) improved.

       They'll go about their lives, enter houses and come
       out bringing goods to stores and getting  something
       for themselves. Stores will re-stock,  people  will
       have new items to trade with you and something  old
       and used will be given away (dropped) for free from
       time to time. Now you need to  pay  more  attention
       not to exploit the villagers - otherwise  the  life
       won't be so prosperous.

 - animals appear more commonly in the villages.

       Wether they are kept outside or inside  there  are
       some animals  in  every  village -  there  are  no
       specific farms anymore. And if there are any watch
       dogs around it may be a good idea to try to  avoid
       them.

 - Njerpez warriors have improved their camps.

       They've learned to build small  storehouses  where
       they seem to keep their booty.

 - SURVIVAL-skill improved.

       There's a new option for  collecting spruce  twigs
       which you now must be carrying before  they can be
       used in making a shelter.

 - New building option: build a gate.

       It's now possible to build a gate  into  a  fence.
       The option can be found under [M]ake items in  the
       section "Buildings & Misc.".

 - pack animals carry varying loads.

       This depends on the  animal  size  and  strength. 
       Cattle can carry more than a sheep, and horse can
       carry more than a cattle, and so on...

 - animal skins and their processing heavily improved.

       First a bit of terminology:
       - Animal skin is a fresh skin removed  from  the
         carcass. It will spoil within few days if  not
         tanned or cured.
       - Curing means processing the fresh skin so that
         it will preserve for a longer time. There's  a
         new HIDEWORKING option  "Cure  the  skin"  for
         this purpose. Curing is used if you don't want
         or can't tan the skin right away and  want  to
         preserve it to be tanned later on.
       - Tanning is a process for softening the skin so
         it can be  used in  clothing. There is  a  new
         HIDEWORKING   option   "Tan  the  skin"  which
         replaces   the   old  "Produce  fur / leather"
         options.
             Tanning  always  requires  usage  of  some
         tanning material  which  may be either willow/
         alder bark or animal fat. It  is  rubbed  onto
         the skin and the skin is left  to  get  tanned
         for some time.  All  the   tanned  skins  will
         appear  as  "Tanned  <animal>- skin"  in   the
         character's    inventory    screen.    However
         depending on the animal, the  tanned  skin  is
         always  either  leather  or  fur.  E.g. tanned
         cattle skin is leather and tanned fox  skin is
         fur and so on.

       * There's a new inventory screen section  called
         "Animal skins".  All  the  skins  will  appear
         under this title.
       * Prices of animals skins  have  been  improved.
         Now  the  skin quality and type of  the animal
         really matters.
         E.g. lynx, beaver  and  pine-marten  are  very
         valuable. Remember that  people  usually  want
         tanned  skins,  plain  fresh  skins  aren't so
         valuable - if wanted at all.
       * There are  some  changes  in what kind of  fur
         and leather clothes you can make  by yourself.
         It's also shown in the finished  product  what
         animal was used. The animal used also  affects
         to protective values of  the  finished  cloth.
         E.g. a shirt made of bear skin is thicker  and
         warmer than the one made of cattle skin.

 - carcasses won't stay around for ever.

       They will rot away or get  eaten  by  carnivores
       usually within a week.

 - you'll also get the fat of the dead animal with "cut a carcass" option.

       The animal fat can be eaten or used in tanning.

 - new TIMBERCRAFT option: "remove bark"

       With this option you can remove and get the bark
       of willow and alder trees. The bark is  used  in
       tanning. 

 - added new people: foreign traders.

       You may occasionally encounter parties of foreign
       traders who are after fine furs of the north  and
       usually carry plenty of fine  metal  armours  and
       swords with them.

 - people can give you better directions.

       Nowadays they can also tell you the name  of  the
       region where the place you are looking for is.

 - new chat option.

       Asking for directions can lead  you  to  find  out
       who among the people (in the village for  example)
       carries the one specific item you are after.  This
       is useful when you are looking for something  that
       can't be found from the storehouses. 
       "Where can I get a specific item?" is a free  line
       you could try if you don't want to use pre-defined
       chat-lines.

 - item making improved.

       If  you  use  leather,  fur  or  cloth  as  a  raw
       material it will  get  used up gradually depending
       on what kind of items you will be  making  out  of
       it. For example you can make various small clothes
       from a one big pelt, or you can cut your shirt for
       a bandage or two and still be able to  wear  it -
       until it's completely worn out or used up.

 - added new command: [F10] - take a screenshot

       The screenshots will be saved in .PCX format into
       a SHOTS\ directory in your UrW directory. There's
       a possibility to comment the screenshots  if  you
       want to.
          Notice that the screenshot option works nearly
       everywhere in the game.
          So go on setting  up  your  UrW  galleries  of
       greatest or worst game situations!

 - initial mastery of skills (depending on  the   chosen
   culture) slightly re-arranged.

 - Minor change in "Hunter's request to catch a fox"-ritual

   Instead of  immediately  encountering  a  fox  now the
   _possibility_ to encounter a fox  is  increased  after
   performing the ritual. You'll usually  need  to  track
   the fox down or at least wander around a bit in  order
   to encounter your prey.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version: 2.50
released: Mar-01-2001

*** NOTICE! Saved characters from the previous versions are NOT compatible ***
***         with this version.                                             ***

 First I would like to point out that this version is DAMN GOOD &   more
 reliable and exciting than ever! Secondly the  following  persons  have
 greatly helped me in development of this version:
 Juho Tukkinen & Timo Ryynnen (Finland)
 "Dax" (Soviet Union)
 Chris Allcock (England)

 Then, the changes:

 - lots of bugs fixed, some of the most fatal ones have been
   found and slained. It looks like none of them survived.

 - new start-up scenarios: "Runaway slave" and "Lonely settler"

       Also "Plague" and  "Maps and written works"  start-up
       scenarios  have  been  removed  and  stories  of  old
       scenarios  have   been  rewritten.  They  now  better
       descripe the background of  your  character  and  may
       give you a new kind of perspective  to  start  living
       your character's life.

 - new game-info browser pictures for Fox, Wolf and Lynx.

 - changes in armours:

       Scale armours  have  been  ruled  out -  they  really
       didn't belong to the world.
       Plate armours are now known as Iron armours  -  Plate
       Halfhelm is now known as Iron Halfhelm and so on.

 - added possibility to reroll physical and mental attributes
   during character creation.

 - you can cook only up to 40 cuts of meat at a time.

 - added display for direction of heard sounds.

       Directions of sounds you hear are now  shown  in  the
       "Heading box". They are shown by  little  exclamation
       marks and will stay visible after the sound until you
       turn your direction.

 - new command: <4> - Repeat previous make command.

       This key-command repeats previous <M>ake command.  It
       is useful if you want to make more than one  of  some
       specific item - for example a bunch of arrows.

 - weather statistics are displayed graphically.

       Horizon window (in the statistics section) shows  you
       the cycle of the sun and the  moon, how cloudy it  is
       and the rain. It looks very nice and gives you better
       and whole new feeling of days and  nights.  There  is 
       also  a   simple   thermometer   indicating   current
       temperature.
         Changes in temperature have been also fixed  to  be
       more realistic. It's possible to experience long warm
       and cold periods as well as rapids changes. This also
       gives a possibility of milder, more  bearable  winter
       periods.

 - lots of fresh musics and sound effects.

       All  the  background  music  (except the  start-tune)
       have been  changed  and  some  game  screens ("Armour
       coverage" for example) now have background music.
         Because of this there's also a  new  setup  option:
       BACKGROUND MUSIC ON/OFF - just in case.
         There are also lots of new forest and animal sounds
       which are most of all realistic. When   you   hear  a
       reindeer puffing or a lynx growling in anger for  the
       first time in this version it may at the  very  least
       sound odd, but the new sounds are originally those of
       real animals. (P.S., angry   Lynx  is   my   personal
       favorite at the moment)

 - possibility to build cottages and saunas!

       It's done  by  <M>ake  command. (There is a new build a
       cottage/sauna option) Decision  between a cottage  or a
       sauna is made  only  at  the  very  last  step  of  the
       building task. Be prepared to spend some time and logs.
       
 - zoom-maps improved.

       Among the other things you can now  occasionally find
       also little ponds of water and fallen trees.
         Also the surrouding areas are now generated as  you
       zoom into terrain or enter a  location.   So  if  you
       enter a village with a field on its  right  side, you
       can actually see the field from the village-scale map
       and so on. Besides the fact that it looks  very  good
       and  increases   atmosphere,  it   also   gives   you
       possibility to for example  fish  by the shores. Also
       as a hunter you can more tactically chase animals  on
       the zoom-area  as  there  maybe   surrounding   areas
       (water, mountains) where your prey can not escape to.

 - 'Map of know areas'-screen (F6) improved.
      
       The traps you've set, villages, settlements  (including
       your cottages) and caves are now shown on this  screen.
       Traps are also shown on the wilderness map too  so  you
       don't have to rely on your memory too much anymore.

 - 'CharacterFile' command-line parameter option removed.

       The game also won't be finished (meaning returning back
       to OS) when a character dies.

 - map borders are shown with light reddish raster line.

       This will help you to better  realize  for  example a
       zoom-map or a village borders.  Also  if  you  exit a
       zoom-map (or a village  etc.)  by  walking  over  map
       border you will be asked if you really wish to do so.
   
 - changes in Njerpez war camps.

       War  camps  are  now   outdoor  terrain  areas  where
       Njerpez  warriors have  built  shelters  and  settled
       down. Map symbol for the camps remains unchanged.
      
 - some changes in inventory list:

       All weights are now total (tot.), not unit, weights.
       Some colors have been added to  inventory  list  and
       item weights have been aligned to right.

 - new command: <D> - Discard items.

       Sometimes region you live  at  may  get  filled  with
       unnecessary items, such as  spoiled  food  or  broken
       armours or anything at  all  that  you  don' t really
       need no more. <D>iscard command  removes  some  items
       from the game for ever. As you should  take  care  of
       your own waste it's suggested  to  remove  items  you
       REALLY  don't   need   from   time   to  time -  your 
       neighbourhood and surroundings will also get in order
       and more beautiful that way.
     
 - frostbites are shown in "Wounds"-screen as little bruises.

 - graphical compatibility improved.

       If the game works fine on your system you can  freely
       ignore the following:
       There's a new command-line option: GFXFIX  which lets
       you manually set up the graphic interface if the game
       doesn't seem to display  graphics  correctly on  your
       computer. Also if the game detects some  problems  in
       graphic initialization this option  is  automatically
       started. See  URW.DOC   for   more   info  on  GFXFIX
       parameter.

 - graphical improvement.

       * Some  tile-graphics  and  game-screens  have   been
         redrawn/improved.
       * Sleeping creatures are shown to be upside down with
         that 'Z' symbol on top of them.
       * Escaping and  fighting  creatures  are  marked with
         little symbols  so  you  can  instantly  see who is
         escaping and who is attacking you. 
  
 - do-it-yourself item 'Primitive rope' replaced by 'Leather rope'.

       As the name says it's made from raw leather. You  can
       make more than one rope in one session if the leather
       is big enough.

 - sensitivity to coldness reduced a bit.

       The coldness affects the character a little less  now
       but it still does so, and the winter still is  a hard
       season for a lonely wanderer.

 - added <W>armth option to "Armour protection" screen.

       You can now check out  warmth  of  your armour(s) and
       cloth(es) from "Armour protection"  screen.  This  is
       mostly useful at the  wintertime.  <F>ire  protection
       option has been removed.

 - LOCKCRAFT-skill has been removed.

 - attitude of the people may now change from social interaction.

       Villagers  and  the  people  you  are  involved  with
       eventually get to know you and may turn  from  unkind
       to friendly and so on. But this isn't something  that
       happens overnight or quickly.

 - self-made fences can be kicked down.

 - empty containers can be filled with rainwater.

 - time needed to load a crossbow has been reduced a bit.

 - written works have been removed.

       There are no more literature, spritual or description
       scrolls - only maps. 

 - traps improved.

       There  are  three  new  traps:  loop   snare,   small
       lever-trap and big-lever  trap -  game  info  browser
       tells more about these. All of these traps  can  also
       be made by yourself. The previous fox trap, wolf trap
       and bear trap have been removed and the new traps are
       somewhat the replacement for those.

  There are two major changes that  will  affect  the  whole
  atmosphere of the UnReal World and give you lots to learn:
  ----------------------------------------------------------
(1) The money doesn't make the UnReal World go round anymore.

       Money, as we knew it  before,  is  history.  All  that
       was previously buying  and  selling  is  now  trading.
       You'll notice how things are done when trying  to  buy
       something in the old way.  Also  there  are  no   more
       places  where  you  could sell your things by dropping
       them and  getting money in return. It may take some to
       get  used  to  this but that's how  things  are  now -
       and  maybe  you'll have to change your attitude to the
       life in the UnReal World a bit.
          When you get into trading you should know that  the
       person you are trading with decides what he/she  wants
       from you. There is however possibility to make him/her
       give you a new offer. Notice that your trading partner
       ignores weapon you are wielding or armours/clothes you
       are wearing. So if you wish  to  trade  some  of  your
       wielded/weared items you should take them  off  before
       trading. All of this will get more clear to  you  when
       you get into trading in the game.

(2) Villages/settlements have been changed.

       Atmosphere and outlook of  the  villages is now pretty
       much different. Lots  of   building-types   have  been
       removed or re-named. There are no more so  many  shops
       and no bars or inns at all. Villages now consist  more
       of houses  of  ordinary people, sheds and  storehouses
       and they tend to be smaller than previously. There are
       also  women and children around as well  as  sometimes
       animals and stuff outdoors. Also titles of some people
       have been changed. Here is a list of some changes  for
       you to get the idea:
       * Miller -> Granary
       * Shopkeeper -> Craftsman
       * Farm -> Animal shed
       * Shipwright -> Fishing shed
       * Fisherman -> Fish storehouse
       * Lexigraphers, armories, apotecharies and  chandlers
         have been removed.
       * Militiamen -> Elder tribesmen

 - if you 'buy' (in fact trade it to  something)  an  animal
   from animal shed (previously know as 'farm') you'll  also
   get a rope for leashing it.

 - added new things to cook.

       These are: Meat dish, vegetarian dish and fish soup.
       Other changes: Berry soup has been moved to 'Drinks'
       cooking  category.   'Soups  &   boilings'   cooking
       category has been removed and  recipies  from  there
       have  been  moved  under  new  'Additional'  cooking
       category.
       
 - new option: milking

       Yes, it's now possible to milk some animals - sheeps
       and cattles for example. Milking is  done  by  using
       'fill empty container'  (key  sequence: #f)  command
       beside the animal you wish to milk.

 - mountain goats have been removed.

       Those damn tough creatures who did't fit to the UnReal
       World anyway have been removed. And now that they are
       gone I know you're missing them already...

 - fire behaviour fixed and improved.

       Fixed the bug that caused you to immediately burn when
       walking over the map border if there was a forest fire
       on the other side.
         Added possibility to feed  the  fire  and  burn some
       other items besides the firewood.  The  fire  must  be
       started with firewood but you  can  also set or  throw
       clothes, wooden items etc. burning  materials  to  the
       fire to make it burn longer - or just to  get  rid  of
       some equipment.

 - encounters fixed.

       Sometimes it happened that you encountered something  but
       never really found the  creature  on  the  zoom-map. That
       should be fixed now.

 - food preservation improved.

       Now the food will preserve much longer at the wintertime
       if left outside or even carried with when the weather is
       cold. Also the  food in the  storehouses doesn't spoil -
       this sometimes happened in the previous versions.

 - trap-pits improved.

       Now you don't have to worry that a creature in the trap-
       pit could attack you unless it's very tall,  clever   or
       agile. Humans, bears, wolves and  gluttons  for  example
       may still be able attack you even  from the trap-pit but
       smaller and less agile animals can  be  easily  finished
       from the edge of the trap-pit without danger.

 - CLIMBING-skill improved.

       You can  now  use  CLIMBING-skill  to  climb  trees  for
       observing.

 - 'potions' containing something to  drink  are  from  now  on
   know as 'mugs'.
 
 - item making improved.

       There's a whole new '<M>ake items' category: Weapons.
       All the weapon-like items to make can be now found under
       the 'Weapons' category.
         There are also few new items to be made by yourself:
       * shortbow 
       * arrows
       * mugs
       * skin
       * javelin
       * torch

 - added possibility to save/load randomly created worlds.

       In the course of random world creation it's now possible
       to save created worlds (if you happen to like  them)  or
       instead of generating a random world  to  load  a  world
       from a disk. (...sounds like there's a map-editor coming
       out one day...)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       to fix weapons - you just have to get new ones from  time  to
       time.

 - object maintenance is possible to cancel.
 
       In some cases object maintenance (who you've encountered it
       will know what I'm talking about) may be taking too long  -
       now it's possible to cancel it, save the game  and  run  it
       again when you've some time. More info will be shown as the
       maintenance starts.

 - added some chatty people.

       Some people have now stories and  tips  to  tell  you.  Try

released: Nov-11-1998

 *** NOTICE! Saved characters from previous the versions are NOT compatible ***
 ***         with the version 2.20.                                         ***

 - completely new graphics and outlook!

       The game uses now 640x480*256 graphics mode  and  looks  very
       much better than previously...or what?
         Some game-screens have been re-arranged in order  to   look
       and work better.
         Some neat graphical candies and  background  pictures  have
       been added as well.
         Graphical presentation of wounds is also new and rewritten.
         Game info browser has been made  graphical  and  there  are
       some pictures in addition to just a plain text.
         Sleeping and dead creatures are now more clearly  presented
       by 'Z' or bloodstains.

 - a whole new random world generator!

       The random world consist now of 20 * 20 wilderness maps.  The
       terrain generated is also more realistic and natural. Now you
       may expect there to be swamps  near  water  etc. The  terrain
       also somewhat matches the real terrain you could see  in  the
       far north where the UrW is placed.
       The wilderness map scale has been changed from 1 kilometer to
       100 meters. This brings you more detailed wilderness map  and
       more relaxed way of playing as a single move on the wildernes
       doesn't take so much out of you.

 - lots of new game info available!

       Use  the hypertext game-info browser!  There  is  a  list  of
       main topics which provides a good and  clear base  to  start.

 - zoom-maps improved:

       1.Zoom-maps are no longer disposable. This brings a whole new
       aspect to for  example  trapping,  lodging  and  encountering
       creatures. You don't have to cut the corpses for  meat  right
       away, you don't have to set your traps  again  after checking
       them, you don't have to worry about leaving  your  things  on
       the zoom maps...because they will be there when  you  zoom on
       the same map again.

       2.You may find water-puddles from the  zoom-bogs and  swamps.

       3.There is a new terrain-type called  thicket.  This  prefers
       to thick area trees such as alders and willows.

       4.Names of zoom-maps are also generated now. So if you wander
       on the wilderness map at the area called "Kaira" and zoom  in
       the terrain the zoom-map name will be  something  like  "Pine
       swamp at Kaira" or "Rugged  Heathland at Kaira"  depending on
       the terrain. This kind of map names  in  the  character's log
       (for example) may help you to better  remember  the  area  in
       question.

       5.Rocks and branches may be found lying around zoom-maps.

 - new commands:

       <h> - Hiding. With this command you  can  hide  if  there  is
       proper cover available. When hidden you may lurk for  enemies
       and animals or try to approach them  without  being  noticed.
       Creatures can however hear or scent you.

       <-> - Stand by. With this command your characters  stands  by
       for a 24 hours or until you cancel it.  The  command  can  be
       used to wait for example a night to fall, the sun to rise, an
       animal to come around, a fire to warm you up or etc.  It  can
       also be used to let time pass for example when  you  need  to
       recover from your wounds.

       <:> - Examine a location. This  command  shows  you a list of
       items etc. at your position or type of the terrain.

       <M> - Make items.  This  commands  allows  you  to  construct
       various items and constructions from clubs to ropes and  from
       fences to traps. Check it out!

 - new items:

       Rock - just a plain rock. Can be used as a primitive  weapon.
       Cord - tying equipment shorter than a rope.
       Light spear - light, simple and somewhat fragile spear.
       Bandage - bandages are now separate items which  have  to  be
       made with <M> command. They are used to tie up wounds.
       Wooden stake - long and slender piece of  wood  made  out  of
       slender tree trunks. It has various uses.
       Trunks - you get trunks by falling trees. They vary in  size,
       length and thickness.
       Firewood - chopped pieces of wood used for building fires.
       Block of wood - pieces of chopped tree trunk.

 - changes in shooting with bows:

       1.It takes now some time to load the crossbow so it won't  be
       very useful weapon in the combat anymore but a very effective
       weapon in the situations where you have plenty  of  time  for
       loading or you want to be  ready  to  shoot  and  still  move
       around with a loaded weapon.

       2.It takes also some time to draw  the  normal  bow  when you
       choose a <t>hrow command to shoot with your bow. So  even  if
       you have target in your sight it may move away while you draw
       your bow. This makes bows quite useless in close-combat.

 - animal improved/new animals:

         Squirrels may climb in the trees.
         Added new animals: Black grouse, Arctic fox, Ermine, Weasel,
       Polecat, Pine-marten and Badger.
       More information about these creatures can be found from  the
       game-info browser.

 - TIMBERCRAFT-skill improved:

       There are few sub-skills: fall a tree, chop a tree into blocks
       and chop a block into firewood. It makes difference wether you
       fall trees from a thicket or try to fall a big spruce or pine.

 - TRACKING-skill improved:

       It takes some time to check out the  tracks  and  the  results
       aren't so clear and definite as previously.

 - added food spoilage:

       Raw meat and raw fish is are easily perishable. Breads and the
       like will be preserved longer. Salting or cooking up the foods
       for preservation is recommended.

 - weather improved:

         Added rain:
       Sleeping outside may be unpleasantly interrupted if it  starts
       to rain. (But You can build shelters now)
         Temperatures are more effective:
       It may get very cold even by the autumn now. You are  unlikely
       to be able to sleep outside by autumn or winter without proper
       clothing or making a fire.

 - NORMAL_CONTROL config option removed:

       Regrets for those who used  it  and  good  luck  learning  the
       tricky but more effective moving system.

 - SURVIVAL-skill improved:

         Added a possibility to build shelters.  Shelters  are useful
       and sometimes essential when spending a night outside as  they
       keep you at least safe from the rain.
         Build a fire-option improved. Now you do not select firewood
       from the inventory but just set the wood you wish to  burn  on
       the ground and set them on fire by using "Build a fire"-option
       to the correct direction. There may be branches and trunks and
       blocks of wood all mixed up and you can throw more firewood to
       the fire if it starts to burn out too soon.

 - trap-hunting heavily improved:

         There is a whole section for traps under new  <M>ake-command
       and from there you can build a  traps  or  improve  and  cover
       trap-holes. You should really check out this section!
       Traps are now longer set on the wilderness maps. They must  be
       set on the zoom-maps and you have to remember it very  clearly
       where you set your trap in order to be able to  come  back  to
       check it.
         There are two new traps: "Kpllauta"-fox trap and Wolf-trap.

 - It's easier to use punts nowadays. You don't  have  to  use  sesta
   every time you wish to shove your punt ahead.

 - You don't have to stand on the corpse to skin/cut it anymore. Now
   it's enough if you stand nearby it.

 - Villages and the people in them affect a bit more to the  terrain
   around. You may see marks of fishing,hunting,timberwork etc. when
   exploring the wilderness nearby villages  -  you  may  find  this
   useful sometimes.

 - Chat improved:

       Chat-option "Region information" renamed to "Ask for directions".
       People may also know much larger areas than previously if you ask
       them for directions.
         Added "Trade items" chat-option. With these option you may  try
       to trade things with people. Now the encounters  with  people  in
       the wilderness may be very useful if they happen  to  carry  just
       the item you want and are willing to trade it into something  you

 - new regional events:

       - "New settlement":
       People may build new settlements around the  wilderness.  You
       may want to interact  with  these  settlers  for  example  by
       trading items etc.

       - "Rich animal population":
       From time to time the terrain may be blessed which very  rich
       animal population of some species. For  example  a rich  elk,
       deer etc. population with the  knowledge  where  the  animals
       have been seen will provide very  good  supply  of  meat  for
       a long time.

       - "Lack of wild animals":
       The terrain may also suffer from the lack of the wild animals
       which may considerably make the living harder as the  hunting
       may get very unsuccesfull.

 - relation between cutting a corpse and hideworking changed:

       Skinning  the   corpse  with  HIDEWORKING  skill  is  now  an
       independent operation which leaves the corpse  still  present
       and to be cut for meat. Cutting a corpse before  skinning  it
       however makes it impossible to skin  the  corpse  afterwards.

 - ritual/supernatural section heavily improved!

       See game information about RITUALS and MYTHOLOGY for more info.

 - added few new start-up scenarios.

version: 2.15
released: Jun-02-1998

 *** NOTICE! Saved characters from previous the versions are NOT compatible ***
 ***         with the version 2.15!                                         ***

About this version:

This UrW version contains some features that are not really fully
functional and practical right now but in the next version.
UrW is going to change a lot from now on and I have so much work
that I felt an urge to release a new version now. Otherwise it would
have been taken very long to hear anything from UrW. Now that the
new version is out and some of the most urgent innovations are added in
the game I can safely and peacefully build the game further.

- quest rewards improved:

       You can now be rewarded in very various  ways.  These rewards
       are also more  realistic  and  maybe  more  useful  than  the
       previous ones. Have fun getting yourself rewarded!

- clothes and armours will be automatically weared when the game starts.

- encounters may occur during the night when sleeping out in the wilderness.

- added new skill: TIMBERCRAFT.

       Timbercraft is a general ability to cut down tree and produce
       lumber such as rollers, logs etc. It's also very good way  of
       making huge amounts of firewood.

- added new ritual: safety of the night.

- added new kind of settlements:

       In addition to big villages it's now possible  to  find  also
       find small settlements kept up by a single  family  or  small
       group of people. These settlements are not places  for  doing
       business and they  usually  have  a  bit  different  kind  of
       buildingsthan the villages; storehouses and drying barns and
       other useful and necessary buildings.

- added few new quests.

- hypertext browser improvements:

         When you mistype a word the browser won't take  you back to
       the first topic but stays in the current topic.
         Scandinavian letters  and  (which  are  needed   in  some
       keywords) can be typed by  non-scandinavian  keyboard  layout
       users by pressing [F1] or [F2].

- added new black & white character faces!

       Some may say they are uglier than the previous ones but  they
       fit much better to the world where the game is placed.

- Chatting improved and a new chat option 'Region information' added.

       With 'Region information' chat option  you  can  ask  general
       information about current region like where you could find  a
       village or are there any lakes nearby etc. Now there is  some
       point of talking to people  who  you  may  encounter  in  the
       if you have gotten lost.
         There are also lots of new ready chat lines to select  even
       during a general conversation. You don't have  to  wonder  so
       much what on earth should I type in to express myself right.
         You can also get back to the previous  topics  during  some
       conversation. This very useful if the chatting goes off-topic
       and you really need to talk more about previous topics or you
       forget something important you have been told earlier.

- Rastering added to make characters range of vision more realistic.

       Creatures, objects, terrain  and  everything  very  far  away
       will now cover in darkness. This brings whole new  excitement
       to the game (especially at night) and causes situations like:
       "What the heck is that? Should I run away or is just a  tame,
        harmless cattle."

- added startup scenarios!

       You can now start playing from various  situations.  You  can
       freely pickup a startup scenario which you find  exciting  in
       the course of character  generation.  It's  my  intention  to
       much more these scenarios in the future. Different  scenarios
       give you different advantages or difficulties to  start  your
       life in the UnReal World.
       (Scenarios work only in the registered version!)

version: 2.14
released: Dec-12-1997

 *** NOTICE! Saved characters from previous the versions are NOT compatible ***
 ***         with the version 2.14!                                         ***

 - added new fishes.

       Salmons, burbots, pike-perches etc. etc.

 - added fur armours/clothes.

       These can be  found  from  armourers  and  hideworkers.   Fur
       clothes are designed to keep your warm and they are  in  some
       cases more protective than leather armours or clothes.

 - added new weapons.
 
       Lots of new kind of knives, spears, bows and  swords.  You'll
       notice them  when  founded.  See  WEAPONS  keyword  from  the
       game-info browser.

 - new cooking category: Soups & Boilings

       This category currently contains only  one  recipe  which  is
       'boiled mushroom'. When poisonous mushrooms are  boiled  they
       may become less poisonous  or  fully  eatable.  Non-poisonous
       mushrooms of course taste better when boiled.

 - starvation added!

       Previously your character would  die  after  couple  of  days
       without food. Now you can stay alive  a  much  longer -  EVEN
       WEEKS - without food. (but not without water)
       There is a new starvation  meter  added  into the  statistics
       section of the game-screen. It will start to grow slowly when
       your character spends too much time without eating.
       (Starvation increases your physical penalty.)
       When you find food again or decide to stop your hunger-strike
       starvation decreases as your character gains energy. This may
       take some time if you haven't been eating for a long time but
       eventually (if you remember to eat well) you  will  get  back
       in shape and suffer from starvation no more.

 - chatting routines improved.

       Even though the people you meet don't appear to  be  'chatty'
       you still have several options to interact with them:
       - you may ask for a help if you are low on food or water.
       - you may ask or hire them to wander with you.
       - you may find someone willing to try to accomplish dangerous
         tasks with you.
       etc.

       Instead of choosing a direction where to  chat  you  need  to
       now select a target for your chatting attempt. This means you
       don't have to be just beside someone to talk to him/her - you
       can chat with people from some distance.
       Some chatting maneuvers however must be executed just  beside
       your target - for example [D]eliver an item.

 - new chat-option 'Ask for help' added.

       This option is used to ask several  kind  of  help  from  the
       other people of the UnReal World.

 - chat-option 'JOIN' removed.

       Creatures will now automatically join with you if that's what
       they want to do. Unjoin-option is still used to leave  joined
       creatures from your company.
       'UNJOIN' option still exists but it  will  show up and can be
       executed only when talking to joined characters.

 - creatures can fight each others!

       You may now happen to witness fights  between  creatures  and
       your companions, pets or fellow- adventurers  may  save  your
       life by helping you in combat situations...or  they  may  get
       killed as well before you can do anything to prevent it.
       This brings a huge load of excitement into the game!

 - creatures sleeping routines improved!

       Even your footsteps can now wake up light sleeping creatures.
       And I guess there is no need to mention that noisy activities
       can very easily wake up creatures even  if  heard  from  some
       distance.

 - lots of new graphics! (scenes and images)

 - new sound effects!

 - added rituals and an active spiritual world!

       You should learn about rituals and the spiritual world during
       your   character's  life.  The  hypertext  game-info  browser
       however contains little information about rituals;
       See keywords: RITUALS, RITUAL and RITUAL POINTS.

       - added a spiritual/religious profile.

         The known rituals are shown here and they are executed and
         performed from this screen  too. You may pop this  profile
         up from the regular character profile screen or by pressing
         [F4].

       - new key command: [F4] - show religious profile.

         This key-command pops up  your religious profile where you
         may check out your religious/supernatural status &

       - added new skill: RITUAL.

         Ritual skill reflects the fact how  well  you  can  perform
         rituals. See more information from a skill-screen.

       - new scroll type: Spiritual Scroll.

         These  scrolls  may  include  anything  from   rituals   to
         spiritual treatise. They are  highly   valuable  for  their
         founder rather rare.

       - CRTPLR improved:

         The  religious  profile  is  shown  during  the   character
         creation. Member of each culture also begins  playing  with
         one known culture-related ritual.

 - GRAPHICAL REVOLUTION!

       Graphics of the character  creator  (CRTPLR.EXE)  have   been
       heavily  improved.   The  game  itself  is  also  made  FULLY
       GRAPHICAL - hope you like it. There are few config options to
       speed up the graphics on the  slow  machines. See URW.CNF for
       more information.

 - lots of new cultures!

       You  really  should  check  out  the  information  about  the
       cultures during the character generation (or see the CULTURES
       keyword in the game info browser).

 - Maps (game items which can be found or purchased) improved.

       Maps are more rough  and  inaccurate as previously. Important
       locations such as villages and caves are still marked in  the
       maps but you can't count on the maps too much anymore.

 - added sentimental pictures and scenes.

       In some courses of the gameplay graphical  pictures,  scenes  or
       descriptions may appear  to  better  reflect  the  mood  of  the
       current event. You can enjoy  them  as  long  as  you  like  and
       usually get rid off them by pressing any key.

 - added a couple of new quests and conversations.

 - Added new animals.
   + names of some animals are corrected to  be  more  suitable for the
   UnReal World:

       Corrected names:
       Hind -> Elk       [Stag (male elk) remains the same]

       New animals: [See game info about ANIMALS for more information]
       Reindeer,
       Wild Reindeer,
       Beaver,
       Glutton.

 - descriptions of the animals added into the  game  info  browser and
   linked to the looking function.

       See keyword ANIMALS for  hypertext  browser ( [F1] ).  Notice
       that all of the descriped  animals  do  not  yet  necessarily
       exists in the game.
       Whenever you choose to look a creature which  has  more  info
       available in the hypertext browser you will be asked  if  you
       wish to read this information.

 - added some animal pictures.

       When looking at some animal with  an  available  picture  you
       can choose if you want to see the picture as well.

 - added new human type: Medicine man.

       Healers, wise men, seers etc. can be found from the villages.
       They may heal your wounds or cure your illnesses.  Find  out
       what these powerful and appreciated persons can do for you.

 - added new building type: Drying barn.

       Dryings barns were used to dry and tresh the grain. They  can
       be found from villages or nearby the settlements.

 - chat-mode improved.

       As an addition to only typing in a line you wish  to  say  to
       your chatting partner you may now some time select  some line
       from the various  choices  which  will  appear  in  the  some
       conversations. Result of this kind  of  conversations  varies
       greatly depending on the chosen lines. You should not however
       forget the traditional 'type in your line'-style conversation.

 - caves improved.

       Added  bad floors, chasms, new kinds  of  rooms  etc. If  you
       drop into a chasm and can't find any other way up you  should
       try to climb up through the chasm above.

 - villages improved.

       Added wells, trees and bushes, different kind village  shapes
       and forms.

 - swimming improved.

       If you face some serious troubles in the course  of  swimming
       you are asked if you wish to continue swimming or  swim  back
       on the coast. This means one simple swimming  attempt do  not
       end up in drowning so often anymore if the  swimming  is  not
       succesful. Swimming also now increases fatigue.

 - cooking improved.

       Several meals can be prepared at once. You can  usually  cook
       about five cuts (or fishes or whatever) at the  time  so  for
       example cooking of ten cuts will take only about 40  minutes.
       It's however possible to cook even a whole Elk at  once  even
       though it can be a lengthy process.

 - added new regional event: Epidemic.

       Epidemics can be very dangerous for  the  population  of  the
       region where  they  start  and  this  applies  also  to  your
       character.

 - description scrolls improved.

       Description scroll may now contain also  some  really  useful
       information about items like  how  effective  is  the  weapon
       descriped or how well the descriped armour protects you.

 - #fill function improved.

       Containers (like  skins and bottles) can be  filled  even  if
       they are not empty already. In this case the  container  will
       be emptied first and then refilled with  chosen  liquid.

 - some references to rituals (in hypertext game info browser):

       These should be ignored - rituals are not yet in use.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version: 2.12

 *** NOTICE! Saved characters from previous the versions are NOT compatible ***
 ***         with the version 2.12!                                         ***

 - added chatty people!

       Some people may have a little jobs for a brave adventurer  or
       they can be in need of a little favour etc. etc. So  whenever
       some people appears to be chatty talking to him/her may  lead
       you in the dangerous or  entertaining  task  or a nice little
       conversation. Some conversations are still  pretty  primitive
       but more complicated tasks and adventures are coming  in  the
       future.

 - sound effects added!

       In the some situations of the game play digital sound effects
       can be heard. In order to hear them you should have a  sound-
       blaster compatible sound card. Sounds can be toggled  ON  and
       OFF by editing the config file URW.CNF.

 - natural attacks (bite,kick etc.) against you can't be blocked anymore.

       Weapons can be used to block only weapons. Dodge is  the  only
       choice to avoid natural attacks such as biting, tearing etc.

 - trapping improved.

       Creatures that get caught into your traps may  now  starve  to
       death (and will be found dead) if traps are checked after they
       have been set long enough (usually several days).

 - added new wilderness encounters.

       In addition to  earlier  encounters  also  the  following  may
       happen:
       * Equipment loss/failure etc.
       * Food loss/poisoning etc.

 - armour damage is shown percentually in the inventory screen.

       For example: a Quilt Cowl which is  badly  damaged  and  is in
       about half of it's original condition would appear like  this:
       Quilt Cowl [50% left]

 - creatures (if co-operative) can be requested  to  move  away  from
   your way by pushing them (by walking in to the same location).

 - animals can be used to carry loads.

       Now you can get yourself a horse, bull or whatever you want to
       (is animal is tame and willing to be leashed) and pack  it  up
       with your stuff. There are two new commands to  be  used  with
       pack-animals; [#P]ack and [#U]npack. (Commands can be executed
       by pressing [#] first and then selecting Pack or Unpack option
       from the menu) [#P]ack is used to pack animals  and  [#U]npack
       get  something  that  has  been  packed. To  keep  the animals
       following you, you should leash them with a rope.

 - COOKERY skill improved.

       Instead of just roasting a meat  you  can  now  produce various
       different kind of meals and drinks. Known recipes are displayed
       when you attempt to use COOKERY. Some equipment (such as pot or
       knife) are sometimes required as well as many ingredients  such
       as water, salt etc. Fire is almost  always  needed  to  prepare
       something; you can use man-made fire, fireplace or even a torch
       for this.

 - creatures may now carry and possess some money.

 - key command: [p] - character profile improved.
 
       You can now pop-up several other  screens  from  the  character
       profile screen; skills-screen, wounds-screen, armour analysis -
       screen and character's log. Ths should make things  easier  for
       the  rookies  (no  need  to  remember  so  many  different  key
       commands) and the system more user-friendly. [SPACE]  key  also
       works the same way  as  [p]  so you can from now on just  press
       [SPACE] and the previously mentioned character related  actions
       in the game - including using skills.

 - key command: [F3] - examine creature/location improved.
 
       Instead of just getting information  about  creature or terrain
       also the items in the examined location will be seen.

 - graphics improved.

       - Former 320x200 VGA mode replaced by tweaked 320x240 VGA mode.
         Some screens may look too spacious  and  empty  but  all  the
         space will be utilized in the future.
       - Character profile, Chat, Help and  Skills-screens  have  been
         rebuilt.
       - Graphical wounds & injuries screen added.
       - Added new character portraits.

 - added new kind of scrolls.

       Scrolls may now contain various kind of information instead  of
       just being plain maps. There are: literature, poetry, folklore
       scrolls, treatise (on craft/lore skills)  scrolls  and  scrolls
       containing descriptions of artifacts. Scrolls can be  found  or
       purchased from the lexigrapher. (some of these are still  under
       construction)

 - added new creature type: Military.

       Militiamen keep on law and order in  the  villages  and  border
       lines. From now on (your) crimes won't be ignored.

 - result of human vs. human combat improved.

       As you attack another human or you have been  attacked  and the
       combat ends up when you fall down unconscious,  several  things
       may still happen and save your life:
       Shopkeepers and the like usually call up the military,  outlaws
       and beggars may take your money and/or valuables etc.
       So you are more likely to stay alive than previously.

 - added new skill: HIDEWORKING.

       Hideworking is used to skin the dead animals to get their hide.
       Hides can be sold (what a surprise!) to the hideworkers.

 - cancel option added to direction related functions.

       Door opening, melee attacks etc. can be  cancelled  by pressing
       [ESC] when direction of action is asked.

 - added temperatures:

       Mostly at the  winter  the  outdoors  temperature should not be
       ingored anymore.  Without  warm  clothing  characters  may  get
       severe frostbites when wandering  outdoors  for  a  long  time.
       Characters should regularly seek cover  from  the   caves   and
       villages during the  long  journeys.  Fireplaces  and  man-made
       fires should not be ignored as well.
       Temperatures in the UnReal World vary from (celcius degrees):
       -30 to  +0 at the winter
       +0  to +20 at the spring
       +10 to +30 at the summer
       +0  to +10 at the autumn

 - load carrying improved, added Mobility indicator:

       The mobility indicator in the upper right corner of  the  screen
       tells you  percentage value  of  efficiency  of  the character's
       movements. If the mobility is for example 56% character can run,
       walk,crawl etc. with 56%  efficiency. All the physical penalties
       (INJURY, FATIGUE  and  ENCUMBRANCE)   lower   the   mobility and
       therefore slow down the  character's  movements.  When  Mobility
       reaches zero character can not move at all or can only crawl.
       (See game info browser with keywords MOBILITY and ENCUMBRANCE)

 - added psychical traits:

       Characters may now have diffrent  kind  of  phobias  and  fears.
       There fears of several animals (such as felines,  rodents etc.),
       fears of open places and crowds etc.  Psychical  traits  can  be
       checked out from the character profile screen. When   characters
       fobia etc. gets stimulated  by  some  situation  and  characters
       fails  to  control  his/her  nerves  several  things may happen;
       character may faint, become hysterical etc.

 - lighting improved.

       It gets dark depending on the time of the  day  and  the season.
       Winter is the  darkest  season in the UnReal World; it gets dark
       very early and the bright time of the day is very short.
         There is also very dark in the buildings and caves where isn't
       any light sources such  as  windows  and  fireplaces. This means
       that sometimes your character needs some light  sources  to  see
       around. Torches, lanterns and the like can be purchased from the
       villages and are very  necessesary  in  the  dungeon  exploring.
       Lighting of the areas is also made very realistic: you  can  see
       fires (made by you or somebody else) from far away etc;  dropped
       light sources and creatures in their circle of light can be seen
       easily even if you weren't too near.  Also  creatures (including
       your character) carrying a light source can be seen from  a  far
       and the creatures in the  dark  corners  with  no  light  source
       usually can not be seen. All this brings up many new  strategies
       to utilize in the dark areas.

 - added new shop-types: Chandler, Apotechary and Metalsmith.

       Chandlers  sell  light-sources   such   as  candles, torches  and
       lanterns.
       Metalsmiths sell metal tools and utensils such as shovels,  axes,
       knives and pots etc.
       Apotecharies sell salt, sugar, spices, stimulants and the like.

 - new items added: candles, torches, lanterns, lamp oil,
                    shovels, pots, tea, salt.

       Candles, torches, lanterns and lamp oil:
         All of these can be purchased from the chandler  and  are used
       for lighting up areas. They are classified as a tools and can be
       used by [a]pply command. Lanterns must be filled with oil before
       they can be used as a light  source.  Light  sources  have  some
       variety in the intensity and duration of the light.
       --
       Shovels, pots:
         Shovels are used for (surprise!) digging. Holes digged with  a
       shovel can be used as a traps - try it.
         Pots are used in cooking; for example to boil something.
       --
       Tea, salt:
         These can be purchased from the apotechary  and  can  be  used
       in various cooking operations.

 - throwing improved.

       You can now throw your items/weapons not only to living  targets
       but every location you can see. This is useful when you need  to
       for example light out some dark area where  you   have  heard  a
       frightening roars. Just wield a torch etc. and throw it  to  the
       area you wish to see more clearly.

 - randomize world improved: added roads, fields and new kind of terrain.

       * Fields are usually located near the villages.
       * Roads cruise through the villages  and  can  be  very  helpful
       for the character who has gotten  lost  and  wishes  to  find  a
       village. When you find a road you have good  change  to  find  a
       village as well; although the roads can be quite long sometimes.
       * There is also lots of new kind of terrain: pine  swamps,  open
         bogs, heathland and rugged heathland and backwoods.

 - added new creatures and creature-types:

       * rats and snakes (not poisonous).
       * human adventurers and woodsmans.

 - added avalanches.

       Avalanches occur as a regional events and may reveal new caves.

       Game time of unregistered copy is increased from 7  to  14  game

       There is still some work left in the remembering  of  the  known
       maps but otherwise scrolling seems to work fine.

 - added a new trap: bear trap.

       Bear trap is designed for large beasts and usually can hold even
       a bear between it's jaws. Bear trap is used the same way as  any
       other trap; see  TRAPS  keyword  from  the game info browser for
       more information.

       region can be seen at the top of the map-screen.

 - added regional and non-character related random events:

       In the course of play some major events  concerning  the  current
       region may occur. These events contain this  far; casual  Njerpez
       military expedictions, disasters (fires, flood,  avalanches)  and
       terrorizations (marauding creatures or crimes/crimewave caused by
       organized criminals). This kind of events are quite rare but they
       can greatly change the character's way of  life.  Whenever  major
       event is coming up, the player will  informed  about  it  and the
       event will be logged in the character's log.

 - added new command: <L> - Show character's log

       Some character activities and major events (such  as  wars  etc.)
       are now logged and can be browsed via this  command.  Time,  date
       and the place where logged  activity  takes  place  can  be  seen
       in the log.

 - new shop type: second hand shop.

       the most mixed sortiment of equipment - practically  any  object
       that is ever made on the surface of the UnReal World.

 - the fire burns! (in case you did not know ;-)

       Man-made fires, forest fires etc. can be very disastrous for the
       wanderer who does not understand to avoid them.

 - new graphical version of the character creator (crtplr.exe).

 - armour coverage options improved.

       When checking overall armour coverage ([A]-command) or  coverage

       protection protection against different kind  of  attack aspects
       such as blunt, edge, point, tear etc.

       World now. See keyword NJERPEZIT from the game-info browser [f1]

       MCGA compatible VGA adapter is required. Chat-procedure  is  now
       fully graphical (including faces of talking characters),there is
       a graphical start-up screen, graphical character profile, armour
       coverage screen and help screen. Graphic system is still heavily
       under development but it shows the way where we are going.

 - wound treating (PHYSICIAN skill) improved:

       Now you will need some equipment such as bandages  and  water to
       treat wounds. Wound treating also takes some time. For more info
       see INJURIES and WOUND TREATMENT keywords  from  the  game  info
       browser.

       This means you don't have to give directions etc. when direction

       doors the game checks if you are  heading  towards  a  door  and
       opens/closes it without asking a direction.

 - added shields:

       There are now shields available  in  the  game;  currently  only
       bucklers and roundshields. Also  a  new  SHIELD-skill  is  added

       now also get back to the wilderness by pressing [ENTER]  at  the
       zoom map. This works only when there is  no  other  creatures on
       the zoom map otherwise you must use the old  method  of  walking
       through the map border.

 - bugs fixed.

       - permanent map option removed and forced to be ON.

 - creature revolution:

       - creature behaviour improved:
         Creatures will now react quite much the same  way  they  would
         react in  the  real  world.  There  are  several  patterns  of
         behaviour concenrning escaping,attacking, getting wounded etc.
         Now even approaching  wild  animals  will  cause  somekind  of
         reaction.
       - added new animals:
         squirrel,   rabbit,  fox,  horse (no riding yet though),  pig,
         lynx.
       - removed some (hi)-fantasy creatures which didn't fit  to  the
         UnReal World: trolls, harpies, orcs etc.
       - added diurnal rythm for all the creatures:
         Now you may see an inn getting empty as the people  walk  out
         to get some  sleep,  you  may  encounter  a  stag  having  an
         afternoon nap and you may find villages rather empty as  you
         enter one late at night. Creatures have  different  kind  of
         diurnal rythms: some are active at  the day  (most  people),
         some at the  night, some start seeking  prey  when  the  sun
         sets and/or rises, some spend the whole day sleeping and get
         active at the evening etc. It  brings lots of excitement and
         fun to the game as you learn about different kind of diurnal
         rythms of the creatures.
       - added hearing and smell/taste attributes for creatures:
         Creatures use them  mostly  to  check  out  if  somebody  is
         disturbing their peace while sleeping etc.

 - poisoning improved.

       There is now different levels of poisoning varying  from  nausea
       (which is not lethal at all) to deadly poisoning. So some mildly
       poisonous mushrooms won't make you deadly sick anymore.

 - added armour descriptions.

       When examing  armours  in the inventory screen you will now  see
       description of the armour itself  instead  of  armour  material.
       Description of the armour material can be  however  easily  find
       by following links in the game info browser.

 - added new shop-types.

       - fisherman: sells fish.
       - shipwright: sells sailor equipment; nets, punts etc.
       - miller: sells grain made products: breads, pies, cakes etc.

 - foods rearranged.

       Some new foods, some foods removed, some foods fixed.

 - shop identification improved.

       Every shop has now a sign over their doors indicating which kind
       of goods the shop is shelling.

 - added watercraft: punt.

       Punt is a light watercraft which may be carried  over  the  land
       from a waterway to another. You need a tool  called  'sesta'  to
       move the punt. It's a long staff which is used to shove the punt
       ahead. You can transport heavier loads than you could  carry  by
       loading them in to the punt. In order to use punt;  drop  it  on
       the coast, step in and use sesta.

 - money system improved.

       There are now two kinds of coins;  silver  and  copper  pennies.
       One silver penny is worth of hundred copper pennies.   When  you
       deal with money you don't have to worry about  differenet  kinds
       of coins - the game splits your silver pennies to copper pennies
       if needed. The silver penny is still most usual coin and  copper
       pennies are used only when it  would  be  a  overcharge  to  ask
       somebody to pay a whole silver penny for something.

 - digging improved.

       When digging a solid rock you will now first get a boulder which
       you can break apart or roll away.

 - added traps.

       There is only Fox Trap available so far. Traps  can  be  used in
       hunting or as a tactical weapon in combat situation.  Traps  are
       classified as tools so they must be used by [a]pply command.

       To use trap for hunting:
       - get yourself a trap
       - go to the wilderness
       - set the trap by [a]pply-command.
       That's it. Then just wait for a day or two  (or more)  and  come
       back to see if your trap has been a success:
       - walk (in the wilderness) on the place you left the trap
       - press [Enter] to zoom into terrain
       You will be zoomed into the scenario where your trap is  in  the
       middle of the terrain and possible prey may  be  caught  in  it.
       If your trap hasn't gone off you have to be careful not to  walk
       on it by yourself. Sometimes you just find a trap that has  gone
       off and no prey at all. In that case some far more bigger animal
       than your trap can hold has propably triggered your trap.
       Remember to take your  trap  with  you  before  exiting  to  the
       wilderness again - even if it  hasn' t  been  triggered  yet! You
       have to set your trap again after every time you check it out.

       To use trap as a tactical weapon:
       - get yourself a trap
       - set the trap any place you want but not into the wilderness
       - tempt your enemy to walk on the trap
       - slain the poor thing or do what ever you were up to

       Notice that Fox Trap can hold such creatures as foxes, cats etc.
       but will only slow down and maybe even  provoke such  things  as
       bears, lions etc.
       Readied traps can be triggered by knocking them with some weapon
       or by kicking them etc.

 - Bleeding wound treatment changed:

       [B]-command (Stop bleeding wounds) is no longer in use. Bleeding
       is from now on stopped by using PHYSICIAN-skill just  like  when
       treating any other wounds. When bleeding is  stopped  the  skill
       skill may be used again to treat the wound furthermore.

 - FISHING improved:

       - added new fish-types: pike, perch and roach.
       - added new fishing related item: fishing rod.
       - there is three methods to fish:
         1. netfishing
         2. angling (with fishing rod)
         3. club/spear-fishing: You'll need a staff, spear or  somekind
            of club. The idea is to  knock  down  the  fishes  swimming
            nearby the coast-line.

 - the longknife is from now on called by its ugrian name: "skramasaksi".

 - added cultures:

       Start game info browser with  CULTURES  keyword  for  more info.
       Cultures currently have an  influence  only  in  the  course  of
       character generation (CRTPLR.EXE). There  are   currently  three
       player  selectable   cultures   available.   Different  cultures
       currently affect only to characters attributes, start-up  skills
       and their mastery levels and start-up equipments. In the future,
       cultures will be having a major role in the game.

  - added new weapon: "Kaumolais spear".

  - added new character attribute: Frame.

      Frame tells how the character is bodily build and affects to  the
      character's weight. Frame can be scant, light, average, heavy  or
      massive.
